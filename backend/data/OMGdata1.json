Try to check the weather before booking cause I wasn’t able to use the grill nor sit outside which would have completed the wonderful experience. <br/><br/>3 hours from the airport, you will be using a ferry back and forth but the charges will be paid by the rental office and deducted out of your deposit.<br/><br/>This is A Unique 1!",

The bed was big and comfy, it was warm inside the box and cozy. <br/>A few things to know: it is on a working farm with lots of sheep so you will need good footwear because there is poop all over the path. There’s about a 200 meter trek to the box and the last bit is pretty steep so try not to bring too much stuff with you when you go. <br/>They do have a fire pit and supply wood as well as a sterno for coffee.<br/>There is also a flushable toilet which is nice! <br/> This is glamping at its finest!",

The bathroom in the nearby barn only has the basics (a toilet, no running or warm water). A few cooking supplies can also be found in the barn, but don't expect to be able to cook a full meal (bring some quick and easy food with you). The walk from the parking is short, but steep. Bit pricey, but definitely worth it for a special stay!",

We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend the bird box experience and are so happy we did it.<br/><br/>One area for improvement could be cleanliness- we found a bunch of hairs on the pillows and sheets, there were a number of Beatles and other bugs in the bird box including under the mattress, and there was trash in the farmhouse garbage can from the previous guests. I’d recommend more thorough cleaning between guests,  as well as providing an electric fly swatter.<br/><br/>Some tips/extra info we wondered about before visiting: We followed our normal map app to the location, which worked perfectly. We carried only a small backpack up with us, which made the 5 minute mostly uphill walk easy. <br/><br/>For dinner, we used the camping stove and water kettle to boil water, which we added to instant soup cups and ate with forks and spoons we brought (all purchased at a grocery store in Norway). There was also firewood and a fire pit. There was no fridge, though the night was cool enough that we felt comfortable keeping yogurt in the farmhouse overnight. <br/><br/>The toilet was totally clean and was a proper flush toilet. We brought our own drinking water, though a small amount was provided.  There was a standard European outlet in the bird box. The heater and vent fan both worked totally good in the cool September night to keep us comfortable. There was also a provided flashlight and there were also overhead lights in the bird box.<br/><br/>There were no curtains, so either bring an eye shade or just enjoy the view in the morning!",

Nicholas was unable to secure a private chef (which I wanted to surprise my wife with) because it was last minute and they were all booked  but he offered to even pick up and deliver dinner for us himself. He also let us check in early since we got there sooner than we thought and the cleaner had already finished.",

        "comments": "We had a wonderful stay at this Airbnb. The location is great as it’s only 20-25 mins drive to Quebec City and there are 2 IGA grocery stores 10 mins drive away. The chalet is perched on a mountain that has multiple hiking trails so there is no need to go elsewhere for a nice hike. The place is very clean. It is compact but has all you need for the comfort of 2-3 people: hot shower, full kitchen,  AC, heated floor and fireplace (one outside and one inside). It even provided children utensils and plates which became handy for my toddler. The only thing to note is that the stairs are outdoor. If you want to access the second floor from inside, you need to take a ladder. (This is well-written on the chalet’s description.)  For those with limited mobility, this is something to consider. <br/><br/>The view is just spectacular. We came on a particularly rainy week but it allowed us see all the various weather changes and how it reflects onto the scenery.  On the sunny day, we went for a hike on the mountain. On the rainy days, we visited Quebec City and its museums. <br/><br/>The host was very responsive. I reached out for technical questions and also information about the mountain. He responded within an hour and more often than not, within 20 mins. <br/><br/>It was definitely a great getaway for my husband, my toddler and I. We are looking to come back in the summer.",

In the morning, the cows mooing was wonderful and humorous to wake up to. Hot tub was clean and warm. Mosquito spray and cooking amenities were provided, as well as a complimentary breakfast. The bed was comfortable and the hanging feature was fun! It doesn't move a bothersome amount. Alina was helpful and easy to reach out to. We had fun using the Victrola! We came during a warm December, but it was never sweaty indoors. The water in the shower was hot with good pressure. The two decks would be an excellent spot to fish, but we just went and bought catfish - we prepared it with the provided amenities and ate by the fire pit. Overall, a highly pleasant experience, and I'll be sharing the information with all my friends. Thanks!",

Hot tub was spacious and clean. Bed was very comfortable and stable, was a little worried about it being suspended with rope,  but they had it pretty secured so it didn’t swing around like crazy. Plenty of soft towels provided with bathrobes. <br/><br/>No indoor kitchen, but electric griddle pans were provided to cook outside. They had eggs, bacon, and orange juice in the mini fridge which was a very nice treat. Keurig coffee maker and coffee was also included. <br/><br/>You’re also about 15 mins away from grocery stores and restaurants so you can go into town if needed and also Village Creek State Park if you want to do some hiking. <br/><br/>Overall it’s a great quick couple’s getaway and would recommend for a glamming experience.",

Using the outdoor shower when it is 38 degrees was difficult dang TX weather lol. LOVED the privacy of being surrounded by water. The hot tub and swinging bed where icing on the cake. Would highly recommend this location. Can’t wait for my next visit when it is warmer ;-).",

The neighborhood didn't match the house in that there were loud  children all around yet a glass house for occupants to be on display.<br/>The noise was really bad, with the children, airplanes flying overhead, and construction that started before 630am.<br/>The house is not sealed as the glass panels and doors have large gaps that allow bugs and noise in, and let's the AC out. Overall, it's a home that may work for families with children as long as being on display is not an issue. And there is no dishwasher even though listed as an amenity. I do not know how difficult it is to remove/edit amenities are with AirBnB, but the response to my inquiry about this was flippant.",

So cool and unique, like no place I’ve ever seen before!<br/>The host was sure to leave lots of thorough directions around the home so you didn’t have any questions which was very thoughtful. <br/>The futuristic vibe is what attracted us to the home but another good feature is its proximity to the airport, it was perfect being so close to SJO as opposed to driving 3-4 hours from somewhere on the day of our flight. We stayed here on our last night in Costa Rica and it made our commute to the airport a breeze!",

There is a nice view peaking out from the upstairs bed room of the Mountains and city (left hand side).<br/>The one annoying thing is, if your just like me and hate construction noise and want to escape it then you will get a tad bit annoyed. I’m from New York City and hate construction noises. So, when I go on vacation, the place I stay at needs to be peaceful, especially from construction noises. At 5:30AM construction starts expect on sundays right in front of this Loft. And its loud it will make it hard to even conversant or even watch a show. Also, right before we had to check out our water was turned off due to the construction. We were talking showers getting ready to leave <- anyone could understand how annoying this is <br/>Especially when you have to check out at a specific time. Its such a bummer because this place would be a 10/10. But because of all of was I explained, It was about 6.5/10 or 7/10.",

I proposed to my fiance here and we hope to be back to celebrate anniversaries for years to come.  The management company was extremely efficient and professional .",

From an architectural point of view, very interesting. <br/>But from our experience there are a few things that have to be mentioned.<br/>First of all there is no air condition in the house only little electric fans. It was hot at night and uncomfortable.<br/>The toilet and shower have transparent door in front of them, so you are visible.<br/>I must say that the next remarks were written before by several guests before us and were not taken care of. <br/>For instance the house was not vacumed. Couldnt use the master bedroom because the sheets were stained.  The corian tub was yelliw inside. No other shower in the master bedroom. We moved to another room, there were hairs all over the floor. <br/>Curtains dirty and hanging loose. <br/>Soap dedpeser in the kitchen broken. <br/>Toilets with shit splash. And the toilet seat with stains that I myself cleaned.<br/>Sofas are old and ruggy.<br/>The owner knows about it now, he dsid he will take care of part of the remarks we sent him<br/>BUT NO AIR CONDITION",

That said, it needs some love, care and paint to look like the pictures; eg. curtains are not hanging right, door handles are missing, it could use a deep clean, and general maintenance. <br/>From the pictures it did not give us the impression that a road runs right in front of the house ( in July there is a lot of car and foot traffic to and from the beach by the end of the road) nor does the pictures  show that multiple houses (probably not built when pictures were taken) are very close neighbors. <br/>Also, there is no A/C - only fans - which makes it practically impossible to cool the house down by just opening the windows (temperatures in the house were above 30 c degrees at all time during our stay).",

The river was a beautiful view to wake up to. The outdoor kitchen was also really easy to use. Kenneth is also such a responsive host. He gave us very clear instructions, great recommendations in town, and made us feel welcome. <br/><br/>The AirBnB is about 30-45 minutes away from Sequoia National Park. It's an easy drive and convenient if you're planning to visit while you're staying in Three Rivers.  I really can't wait to stay again.",

I'm still stunned at how perfect everything was. You can tell that every aspect of 'paradise ranch' was artfully crafted with a specific vision. So many details that only someone with passion for the project would include.<br/>The glass house was immaculate. Everything you could need, all new/high quality items. <br/>Spectacular view and privacy. Great for watching wildlife since they can't see through the mirrored glass. <br/>Hot tub and sauna were obviously wonderful as well. <br/>Overall, everything in the listing is accurate but it can't capture how top-tier this experience is",

It is as advertised and more. I stayed in the Stellar house which is very thoughtfully designed and elegantly placed in this stunning valley. Would have been easy to stay inside and watch the world go by through the glass walls all day. But there is a lot to do on the property. The hot tub is right outside the door. The sauna is a short 30 sec walk away by the river, which is frigid in November but worth the swim :)<br/><br/>Kenneth was very responsive and accommodated our requests leading up to the stay. The listing and glowing reviews are all accurate. It’s really something to experience.",

The living unit is small but well-designed and has everything you’ll need to live through a calm retreat. The glass/mirror construction gave us a full view of the beautiful riverbank yet granted us privacy and calm. The highlights of this trip are the nature surrounding the ranch and the hospitality from Kenneth. Today’s Airbnb experience often becomes transactional and robotic, making an energetic and kind host willing to speak and explain stories behind himself and the place very rare and inspiring. Paradise ranch is for someone who’s seeking a calm, simple, and off-the-grid journey. If you are that person, IMHO, you won’t be disappointed.",

A fantastic little house on the edge of a river with a magnificent view (day and night), everything worked amazing (I'm going to have to buy that bidet for my wife now) and it was a great getaway.  Sequoia/King's Canyon park is super close so sightseeing and hiking is great, or just stay around the house, lounge in the hot tub and take in the quiet and the beautiful views.  We shared some photos on social media and have been fielding questions from friends about where we stayed and how they can do the same since we got back.  Truly a fantastic experience I would unquestionably repeat again.  If you have ANY hesitation about making a reservation, put it out of your mind, it's worth it and an experience you'll remember for a long time to come.",

This place is truly a hidden gem!! <br/><br/>I will say however the drive into Sequoia National Park was a bit longer than we would have liked and the abundance of flying insects was a annoying at times (especially when cooking). But the park itself had a lot of flying insects too so this is not just Paradise Ranch. Bring some all natural bug repellent and you’ll be fine. <br/><br/>Overall we enjoyed the hell outta our stay a would love to come back again! Thanks again Paradise Ranch!!",

It was nice to connect with nature, swim in the river, relax in the cedar wood spa, and cuddle up next to the gas fire pit under the night stars all while enjoying high end modern amenities within the container. The shower is a must! <br/><br/>Some warnings: <br/>The last 10 miles is mildly unpaved with potholes. I would not bring any lowered sports car here. The signs are limited to the ranch and cellular data drops off, so make sure to write or print out the directions given. There isn’t any easy access for food except for about 30 min down the hill so make sure to pack up food for your trip. There is a lovely hibachi grill and gas burner available. <br/><br/>Will definitely come back! Thanks Kenneth for creating this magical place.",

Sold it all, closed\nmy base/ studio and build a dream in the backyard of the Sequoias on a 50 acre ranch with a crystal clear 1 1/4 mile river running through . \nYes, I’m here to serve and this place has been very healing for me so I would like to share the energy and properties of this ancient virgin land . I traveled to Estonia and found these 5 OOD house mirror/selfie houses as some say and brought the company across the pond, all for you to love and connect with the Estonian concept and the Danish minimal luxuries design hand crafted by Americans , I took all the good things that I felt was missing on my travels and compacted it into the essence of what you need to feel nurtured and loved . Nature will heal you here trust me, ohh and yes drink lots of the water here it has very special and healing properties. ;)  ",

In an open-air villa in the middle of the jungle, there was no problem with bugs.  This was my biggest concern, and its absence still baffles me.  Despite heavy rains, our treehouse remained completely dry.  The air conditioned bedrooms had blissfully comfortable & cozy beds.  The bathrooms were spacious & stunning. The lighting design was impressively optimized for the space, its thoughtful flexibility adding to the exquisite experience.<br/>The service was peerless exceptionalism. Their thoughtful, proactive attentiveness gave me the comfort & confidence of a solid safety net, despite being over 10,000 miles from home. Upon arrival, the staff knew us by name and where we were staying. Oka & his team orchestrated a seamless spectacular experience tailored to our individual preferences & tastes. <br/>A week later, I am still in awe.",

Compared to other stays in bali. <br/>The food also wasn’t what you would expect from a place like this. Again especially since the food in bali is amazing. We were underwhelmed. <br/>Certainly worth a visit for the beauty of the architecture but I don’t think worth the money for an over night stay.",

Staying close to nature in the middle of the rainforest with great amenities and amazing views. The service is also very good though you’ll be able to order in the villa by 5pm, not later than that. Be prepared for a few insects though which gather around in the evening - we did get scared because they were all over the place as soon as it became dark. However, within two hours, it all became normal. Breakfast is served from the menu of fixed options to choose from. The food is quite good. Though not a lavish 5 star spread but good enough to satisfy the breakfast hunger. Kitchen is decent, so you can cook for yourself as well. The experience of living in a bamboo house that too near the river getting to hear the sound of water flow and in between the greenery was a great experience.",

The most beautiful accommodation we’ve ever stayed in and the team running Green Village - everyone from arrival, chef, cleaning - were truly amazing and made this trip so special. They were beyond accommodating, often helping us navigate difficult travel situations during the rainy season, even opening the kitchen late when we got stuck in a storm and missed a dinner reservation. Amazing food (we ate here most nights it was so good and authentic), massages in our rooms, and unbelievable scenery. I cannot recommend this accommodation enough!",

The concept is incredibly inspiring. <br/><br/>Slightly expensive for what it was with cleaning supplies tucked in the corners and greenhouse needing a bit of TLC but sweet finishing touches to made it very welcoming. <br/><br/>Thank you for hosting us.",

Our first time in an earthship was great- the space felt safe and comfortable; the architecture was unique and we really value the idea of sustainable living as well as affordable housing for all. I hope more people come to learn that sustainable living is not only possible but beautiful. Thank you for the opportunity & we will be back to explore more earthships.",

The Earthship is beautiful, and my partner and I loved coming home to the fresh plant smell of the greenhouse! The Earthship remained at 70 degrees even when it was 90 degrees outside in the summer heat. The shower is wonderful, and the bed is very comfortable. Wifi worked great. We enjoyed going for a long walk and seeing other Earthships from the road. Only a few minutes drive from the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge, so a beautiful drive every time! I highly recommend staying here!",

Where else can you be in the high-desert one moment and standing next to banana tree in bloom the next? Strong recommend.",

Michael was very helpful and accommodating.  I would recommend this experience! it's really interesting how these earthships are self sustainable.",

During the first day of our stay mother nature had greeted us with a winter storm, including considerable snowfall, and very cold temperatures. We appreciated that some snow had been removed prior to our arrival or we likely would have gotten stuck trying to park. Both nights the temperature reached the sub-zeroes, yet we were amazed that the temperature in the living and sleeping room never fell below the upper 60s, and was quite comfortable. It was fascinating learning about the self-sufficiency aspects of this Earthship and of those in the community in general. It was a great overall experience and we would return.",

The stuffs here are very responsible, friendly and helpful. Since we just got married last Christmas day, we got a lot of wedding photos here by ourselves. The towers makes our photos amazing. Highly recommend this special place for staying at Joshua tree!  Wish we could come here again in the summer!",

It’s so great for a few nights in Joshua Tree because it’s an extremely unique experience.<br/><br/>The best part for us was the fire pit service. I’ve never had “room service” deliver whatever I wanted to us at a fire pit - including more wood for when we ran out but still wanted to continue the night. We had a couple hand made old fashions and then moved into the Hall for a movie. <br/><br/>They had laid out cushions, blankets and pillows on which to get comfy cozy before we ate popcorn and watched a big screen projector. Every one of these services costs extra like sauna, movie night and even morning coffee (there was a nesspresso machine in tower 2 but no pods). The extra costs can add up but it was totally worth having the options! <br/><br/>We are absolutely looking forward to staying here again next time we come to Joshua Tree!",

The entire property was truly breathtaking and unlike anything I have ever seen for a camp type site. The boho style here couldn’t have been more spot on for my hippie self. The owners are very attentive, helpful, and take amazing care of this property. It is located just minutes from Joshua Tree National Park. I can not wait to go back and stay for much longer than one night. If it was an option, I would move there immediately haha. Out of all the things I saw during my stay, The Castle House Estate’s and Joshua Tree National Park made my entire trip everything I wanted, needed, and more. Thank you!!!",

We were lucky enough to find the Castle House estate and were able to book one of the towers 2 days prior to our arrival. <br/>Our entire stay from checking in to checking out was so easy and enjoyable. The owners were so helpful and attentive to all of our request and questions and were a quick phone call/text message away. <br/>Highlights of our stay had to be our time hanging out under the palms  at the pool deck. Sunset strolls through the property’s beautiful landscape. And star gazing from the tower roof top. <br/>We were not very prepared and did not bring any refreshments or food, but thank god they had room service that we fully took advantage of.<br/>Don’t forget to bring your roller skates. The disco roller room has a jukebox and amazing lighting <br/><br/>10/10 Highly recommend. Would stay here again.",

Michelle was a great host and the setting could not have been more beautiful. If you’re visiting in the winter, as we did, you should be prepared for a remote wilderness experience, even though it’s technically close to downtown Boulder. If there is significant snowfall you won’t make it up the steep road to the house without AWD and/or chains. We ended up leaving our rental car at a pullout off the main road and hiking up to the house when the snow was heavy.",

Very cute and secluded with a well stocked kitchen, nice hot tub, and eco friendly. I would definitely bring robes and slip on shoes if you go in the winter as the hot tub is up a hill and can get hold to walk from in the winter months. Otherwise we loved it!

The road is quite steep, but very flat – you don’t need something with super high clearance. When the weather is good, and the road is dry, I believe any car would make it (the neighbors were driving up in a little Smart Car). Once snow falls, I would not feel comfortable in anything less than AWD or 4WD. Again, the dirt road is well maintained, it’s not washed out, but it’s very steep. <br/><br/>Also as a word of caution to others driving up, the dirt road should be taken mindfully as it is only 1 car wide for the majority of it, and you need to be aware if other cars are coming the opposite direction (infrequent, but we did end up having to do a shuffle past someone at one point).<br/><br/>The seclusion is incredible, absolutely astounding.

Wonderful, quick, help & communication from the hosts (thank you Michelle!), made the trip a breeze.  <br/><br/>The well-appointed kitchen with some pantry staples (oils, salt, pepper, white sugar and more) made it possible to really cook real meals at the house.  <br/><br/>The earthship itself was beautiful AND comfortable, inside and out.  As the listing notes, the second queen bedroom is up the hill from the main house by the hot tub, and at the time we stayed, doesn't have running water or a bathroom (you return to the main house for that).  It wasn't an issue for our group, but, if you're worried, something to check out with the hosts as it looks as if they are working on some renovations in that space that may help.  <br/><br/>As for the road, it is mainly steep and narrow, but we navigated it in our SUV with no issue in low gear.    <br/><br/>And, last mention.  Bring a warm jacket so you can stay outside on a clear night so you can see the stars (and the Milky Way at certain times of year!) rising over Sugar Loaf Mtn.  Beautiful.  We loved our peaceful stay at the house, and would certainly visit again.  Thanks!",

Cooked several meals in the eel designed and well stocked kitchen. Parking the first time was a bit tricky but by the second day it was a breeze. Excellent value for a great stay.",

The design is truly stunning, clean, upscale and at the same time a simplified home with an emphasis on function. Absolutely no unnecessary items seen. My favorite thing about this property is that I loved being in the hills, yet it was close to everywhere I needed to go. My three night stay was so peaceful, my favorite thing was waking up in the mornings and hearing the birds chirping faintly whilst having tea on the second floor patio. Then dining at night on the rooftop was just as lovely. The house is so much better than in the pictures, a beautiful vibe.",

It’s on a very busy/narrow street which can get tricky when running or walking but we figured it out! Dorothy is very quick to respond to questions. Getting in was easy and the location is very nice. Close to Beverly Hills shopping, Sunset and the beaches. Have fun there!",

We stayed during the winter so it was a bit chilly, but with sufficient layers + provided heaters/blankets, we had no issues. The hot tub was fun (and a lot of work). I suggest bringing more firewood than you think you’ll need to keep the hot tub going. The place is pretty secluded, but we did see/hear dirt bikes in the afternoon through the evening. We also enjoyed how it was only a short drive to the national park, restaurants, and grocery store. All in all, this place was beautiful and perfect for a short weekend getaway. Would highly recommend!",

This airbnb is off the grid and thus doesn't have conventional heating. The bed has heating pads and will keep you mildly warm while you sleep but when you are awake, you cannot freely roam inside the room. Even while sleeping, we needed the provided couple of propane powered portable heaters to run at full blast. They run out after 2 hours so you need to wake up and change the tank. The tanks needs to be purchased by the guest, we checked in late after 12 AM and fortunately were already aware of the situation so we got tanks upfront, it would have been a nightmare if we didn't know about it.<br/><br/>Overall, good Airbnb but heating is a serious problem, so plan your travel in times where temperatures are moderate.",

It's pretty surreal at first, and you just accept that this is awesome and you gotta make the most of it asap. I really have no gripes about anything. <br/><br/>The hot tub was a funny experience, though. We knew - after watching the provided hot tub video - that we should fire it up as soon as we got there. So that's what we did. I brought a thermometer and checked the water temp about 1.5hrs in and it showed 95 degrees. Perfect! Buuut...we didn't realize that just the surface of the water was warm. I hopped in and the bottom half of the tub was freezing haha. We forgot to mix up the water, and it just took too long to heat up. So my only tip is to fire it up asap, MIX UP THE WATER every half hour or so, and wait about 3hrs for it to be ready for your weary bones. <br/><br/>Karen, the host, was great overall. Very responsive and proactive with communication. Professional across the board. <br/>We had a great time!",

After booking, I was sent instructions and details for the place and it mentioned i needed fire wood for the tub and that it take 3-5 hours to get to 90° degrees. I tried to cancel the place after I found out it was not a traditional hot tub to find a place that has a hot tub thats doesn’t require labor because I was staying just for the night but they said that Its not their fault and I’d have to contact airbnb. I deal with chronic pain so I always want a place with a nice hot tub. It it was misleading to not mention the hot tub needs firewood in the listing, and inconsiderate that they didn’t refund me so i could have found something that works for me as far the hot tub goes. The place is obviously beautiful, but the hosts are not completely transparent in the listing.",

No sheets / blanket was on the bed. The housekeeper was still going back and forth to bring them to the location.  Also the propane was not there. The same lady had to drive to pick up them somewhere and drop them off after 30/40 min. I understand that things can happen and maybe the other guests left the Airbnb later than recommended and they had all this trouble to set in for us but we didn’t hear any sorry or explanation anytime. I was surprising my husband and just wanna to get there with every time looking nice. <br/><br/>Advice: depend on the time of the year you go, expect to not have a warm hot tub, doesn’t matter how much wood you fill in it. We put 3 bundles and waited 4/5 hours and it was still not warm enough.",

Also the sun made outside good enough to take a shower but I wasn’t able to because the water heater never warmed up the water. Overall still has a relaxing experience.",

We would enjoy returning in the future.",

Katherine (host) and her family are very friendly, super helpful, and great at ongoing communication. We will definitely stay here again in the future.

It was decorated in almost a modern Brady bunch way that reflected the character of the home, we felt it was very cutely done.  <br/><br/>Host greeted us with her darling boys who helped carry luggage. <br/><br/>After seeing the tram my group & I decided that was a better way to get up and down vs the steps.  <br/><br/>Few cons but this is also a newly listed home &  just standard kinks to be worked out.  <br/>The host was responsive to bathroom w no lights, a weird deal with the top floor shower.  <br/>I personally felt the home needed a true deep cleaning & cabinet clutter cleared but that’s also just my personal preference & how I live in my day to day life.<br/><br/>Beds were comfy, AC & fans for each room as well.  The beach air also keeps things cool.  <br/><br/>I will say honestly the stairs in & around the home are VERY steep. This would not be ideal for smaller children, elderly with any type of knee or hip issue.  <br/><br/>We did have issues trying to get an Uber to pick us up, in five days not once could we get an Uber.  So I’d advise you request the covered parking at the base of the tram vs trying hike up & down the upper steps.  <br/><br/>Hired Chef Dave for one evening at the House, it’s a great place to bring in a private chef. <br/><br/>Host had a handful of good dining recommendations which we enjoyed.  The arrival snacks were also a treat!",

        "comments": "Amazing location and incredible views. It’s a special place. For parents with young kids just note that there are many stairs inside and they are very steep. Our son is 3 1/2 and is cautious so we knew he wouldn’t use the stairs without waiting for us to hold his hand. But if you have younger kids who toddle around this would likely not work. Depends on the kiddo. However, we had an amazing time and spent every night outside stargazing and enjoying the hot tub. The outdoor spaces are fantastic and the view is gorgeous. Katherine & Rory were accommodating and helpful with our luggage and deliveries, pack & play and baby gear, and had great snacks in the home for us on arrival. It was a special trip for our family.",

The nearby hot springs provide a peaceful escape and unique places like the Crestone Ziggurat are an added bonus to this magical escape not only was the home amazing but the hosts were so wonderful and helpful. I can't wait to come back and escape again!",

It took us a couple of days to get used to the layout but the house grew on us very quickly. <br/><br/>The place warms up quickly and there were plenty of blankets and soft pillows to lounge around on. The stars at night are unbelievably beautiful and the master suite is a perfect spot to fall asleep under them. You will wake up to a beautiful sunrise to start your day of exploring and climbing. <br/><br/>The place is quite Beautiful during the day as well. And the wood fire pit outside was a really fun experience with our kids. We toasted marshmallow and howled at the moon 🌚 <br/><br/>It would have been nice if the pool could be heated higher than 70 degrees but due to it being cold already and the size of the pool being massive the pool attendant said it was impossible. <br/><br/>The super loon light was a nice touch in one of the rooms and honestly we can’t wait to go back.",

The plantings in the greenhouse are just beautiful, the geraniums lent the entire greenhouse an incredible floral scent while not being overpowering.  Just stunning!<br/>We ate out both nights, but the kitchen was perfectly stocked for home cooking.  The bed was super comfortable, and the earthship was immaculate upon arrival.<br/>The earthship is located outside Taos by about 15-20 minutes, close enough to restaurants but far enough away to be very quiet and private.  <br/>We would highly recommend this property and would definitely come back again!",

Definitely put this on your list for places to stay!",

The ship was clean, quiet, and comfortable.  The kitchen had everything we needed and then some.  The Earthship is beside highway US 64, and although it’s not a busy highway, there was a bit of road noise.  Overall, it was a terrific experience and a great place to relax.",

Taos is unforgettable. <br/><br/>We were a bit surprised that there were so many other earth houses, but they weren’t very close by so it didn’t matter. There was a lot of cool literature about Earthships at the stay. <br/><br/>If the US wasn’t so huge and if life wasn’t so short, we would come again. <br/><br/>Beautiful",
