Such a unique and cool place to stay. <br/>The hosts Joanna and fredrico were just fantastic too. <br/>Very helpful and friendly. Just the best kind of hosts. <br/>The place is full of beauty. Everything from  the pool,the views and the hot tub. This place is 11/10 and would highly recommend it to anyone who visits terceira island.",

      "comments": "Cocoon is extremely small and has no space for any bags whatsover. It has no lock and you have to keep your belongings in a shed that is not next to the cocoon, or even in sight of the cocoon. it's closer to another glamping pod with no safety lock for your belongings. Cocoon is considerably far from shared toilets , which is particularly difficult at night when there is no light and you have to cross a difficult unlit wooden carved bridge (which was partly falling apart). There is one toilet and shower for men and one toilet and shower for women, separated by small door which makes for uncomfortable time when you are trying to go, with someone right beside showering. The bathroom facilities are shared across entire glamping campus (there are over 6 other sleeping pods). In order to get to the cocoon you have to walk passed two other pods, which is neither practical nor private. The hot tub isn't included in price, you have to pay €10 for each use and it takes 2 hours to start - the price is not listed anywhere when you are booking. Hot tub is also not private as advertised which was a big problem for us as this was one of the big selling points to book this place. Private means for your use only, which this hot tub was not, and it was also right in front of other guest's pods, which is as far from private as you can imagine.  It is in the middle of a path where people can walk and access regularly so you can't enjoy the hot tub without people walking right next to you. This isn't really a 'private getaway' or 'escape'. When our taxi driver (local) brought us, he didn't know & couldn't find the place - which attests to the fact that it is in the middle of nowhere and not a 20 minute walk from Angra as one of the other reviewers inaccurately recalls. It is 15 minute drive away. We spent just one night here, even though we booked for 4 nights as it was not what we expected or paid for. Despite this, the owner refused our compromise of 50% refund and we were charged for two additional nights that we did not spend there. We spent over 6 hours waiting for the owners and airbnb to try and resolve this issue and meant we had to do a last minute booking elsewhere - more money spent. Joana wasn't even present for us to resolve this problem - so we had to deal with her partner who didn't resolve anything without Joana's approval - a cyclical issue that kept us waiting for 6 hours and still being refused a half-refund. Not the way we'd hoped to spend our anniversary, just very unprofessional manner of handling the situation. Not great customer service, at all.",

It’s an incredible experience to stay in a suspended tent in nature - there’s also a lap pool, and other unique tents! All guests have the chance to plant their own avocados, which is so so cool. It’s a beautiful 20 minute walk from Angra de Heroismo where you can get the freshest fish and cold white wine while you take in the sunset. Joana is an exceptionally kind, generous host who will make you feel at home, even during a short stay (I was by myself and there for 1 day). Go for it!",

The tour of the gardens and the museum were wonderful and gave me a stronger appreciation for the beauty and the landscape of the architecture. It is a little secluded, so bring some food to cook/eat and expect a few critters. Definitely also save daylight time to explore all the different pathways of the garden!",

      "comments": "The apartment is gorgeous. Four levels of architectural beauty. Loved the property and the tour Laura gave us of the rest of the grounds. Laura was also able to convert some money for us to pay a taxi. She was very helpful once we arrived. My cons were location, communication, and ease of exiting and entering the property. The complex is about an hour outside of the city so it was extremely hard getting a ride to/from. No taxi drivers would take us or said it would be double. Communication. I messaged several times a month before our stay with no response until the day we were supposed to check in. They say they offer cab rides and cooks if you inquire but I didn’t get a response on those so we didn’t get a chance to book/reserve. Very frustrating when the hosts don’t respond to messages. Lastly, when we did get a ride to leave, we would get stranded outside because someone wasn’t at the front to let us out or let us in. Overall it was great to experience this place but I wouldn’t do it again. Also, don’t order pizza from Don Carmelo. Several of us got sick from their food.",

The condo on this property was one of the most magical places we've ever stayed, and we highly recommend the experience to anyone who has considered a visit. The accommodations are immaculate in design and usability.  You will have everything you need to stay on the property.  We understand there are places to eat a short drive away, but we came with supplies and did not leave once we were there.  The setting is extremely romantic if going as a couple, large enough for a group of adults, and would be exciting for families to explore together.   Patricia is a perfect host, and gave us a thoughtful tour of the grounds and explained to us Javier Senosiain's vision of how organic architecture is not only beautiful but honors the ground it's built on.  We would love to go back and stay in El Nido again, and I would rate it 10 stars if I could.",

The ability to stay in a world-renowned architect's vision & creation is already mind-blowing, but the actual experience itself is transcendent because you are not merely occupying a habitat- It is fully immersive from the moment you step through the gate and the moment you depart. Patricia is an amazing host - her love and respect for El Nido and kindness towards its visitors radiates from her and shows in everything she does. It was such an honor and privilege to stay here and I cannot recommend it enough.",

Everything you needed for outdoor living was thought of and available nothing was missed at all , we had a very windy night in the globe but didn’t ruin our experience as stayed between Xmas and new year and can not wait to return in the future. We even took our new puppy and she loved everything about it. <br/>Amazing location and very quirky all thought out would highly recommend to others in a heartbeat thank you",

Incredible!!<br/><br/>We arrived after dark with the weather was against us, but the camp was easy to find and luckily set up for all weather conditions. <br/><br/>The fire pit ideally situated next to the outdoor kitchen has water resistant sails above allowing for an evening of fun around the fire sheltered from the rain. Ample logs provided. <br/><br/>The globe is cosy and ideal for a couple or two adults. The sofas convert into one small double and single bed. The bedding was spotless. It was a cold wet evening but we slept very well with small log burner burning through the night. The bells chiming at the local church  didn’t bother us.<br/><br/>The hamper provided was a lovely touch including fresh milk, eggs, bread, butter and marshmallows, amongst other essentials. <br/><br/>The facilities are well thought out providing ample hot water and clean towels.<br/><br/>The host couldn’t have been more welcoming.<br/><br/>Overall we score the experience 10/10 and will return.",

The day we were arriving Laura got in touch and asked if we need anything and if we would like her to meet us and give us a tour to our accommodation or if we wanted to explore on our own we opted for the tour! <br/><br/>Laura met us at the gate and shown us around and we met the piglets… The forest area is just perfection. We lead extremely hectic busy lives so the peace and tranquility was literally a breath of fresh air. <br/><br/>Camp was clean, had everything you could need. We went for dinner at the Langdon arms (Recommended prior by Laura) which was really yummy! <br/><br/>I can’t wait to return back already! Thankyou Laura & Ed was a truly memorable experience x",

I had booked the Globe as an half term adventure for me and my son, and it fitted the bill perfectly. <br/><br/>Laura and Jo were incredible in terms of communications before and during the meet, and they truly excelled themselves with their own little bit of magic to make our stay are real surprise and adventure for the little one. <br/><br/>The Globe itself was cosy and warm throughout the night, even without the log burner lit (during late October). Amazing shower, something refreshing about showering with the woods around you! <br/><br/>Can't reccomend this place enough! Fingers crossed we'll be back soon!",

Such a brilliant location and you really feel away from it all! <br/>Everything you need is there to help you fully immerse in the off grid lifestyle. They’ve really thought about the little details that make your stay as wonderful as possible. <br/>The welcome hamper is very lovely, beds are super snuggly, shower and toilet impeccably clean. Lighting and firewood spot on. And sleeping in the tree pod is such a fantastic experience. Highly recommend",

What I can't wait to try out next time is the barbeque grill. I recommend this stay for anyone looking to leave the city for a quiet and serene getaway.",

    "about": "Originally from Adelaide, Australia I have lived on the African continent since 2003 working in tourism as well as running our own community solar power project Napenda Solar Community.  I have spent the better part of my working life outside of Australia and living all over the World.\n\nThe Castle on Champagne Ridge near Kiserian is our refuge, a place to relax and recharge the batteries. I love to cook so spend my free time in the kitchen working on some new recipe or simply experimenting with various ingredients and textures.\n\nThiemo, my husband, is the brains behind the design of all our 5 cottages (Nest, Dhow, Cave, Tower and Castle). He is a solar power guru and my own personal Mr Fix It! \n\nWe have 5 German Shepherd dogs; Sally, Stella, Beau, Zanny and Pikey who are thoroughly spoiled, although they may not agree!  They love their daily walks, swimming in the dam and playing soccer (football).  Sally and Stella are adopted, while Beau and Zanny are rescue dogs; and Pikey arrived on our front lawn in Dec 2019 begging for food and never left! \n\nThe Castle is open to all regardless of religion, culture, sexual orientation or nationality.  After all, variety is the spice of life. ",

      "comments": "Just got back from a lovely few days at the roundhouse and i would recommend to anyone wanting to get away from everything and relax. The location and views are stunning and it really is secluded and so very quiet! I would recommend taking a torch, your wellies, warm clothes and some hot chocolate to cosy in front of the fire. The only thing that I would say is the doors don't lock so we couldn't 100% relax at night -  completely appreciate is so secluded and a place where you naturally don't need to but it's hard to relax when you're used to having to lock doors but can't. Absolutely loved getting back to nature, thank you and see you next year! 😊",

This was one of the most memorable Airbnb stays we’ve had during our travels. You’ll be immersed in nature and will have a true countryside experience. Do be aware that you will have to walk a few hundred yards from the parking lot to get to the home.  On the day we arrived it was muddy, I wore sneakers and carried a large suitcase on my shoulder.  I stepped on a slippery bit of grass, absolutely ate it, fell in the mud, and yeeted my suitcase as I fell.  So wear boots if it’s wet! The people on the farm are also very nice.  There is a little shop where you can pick up farm fresh veg and they have pasta, cheese, and basic essentials for dinner. I wish I would have stayed here longer!!",

Felt nicely secluded and away from it all. <br/>Be aware the toilet is about 60 metres from the house and you need a torch after dark to negotiate the slippery tree roots. If lighting wood burner you’ll need to use the axe to make your own kindling, larger logs on sale from car park. Idyllic, secluded setting and a wonderful experience x",

The log burner really heated the place up, one night it was too warm we had to have the door open! And we were joined by a friendly cat.<br/>The only fault we had was the outside shower, we were unable to regulate the temperature so be careful as it was scolding hot or freezing cold. <br/>Some tips we would like to share:<br/>Take your wellies it can be muddy<br/>Crocs or flip flops for shower<br/>Take some kindling and firelighters<br/>Great 4G we connected to a lap top and cuddled up to a film that we streamed in the evening. We also took a board game to play - lord of the rings themed escape room! <br/>Don’t forget usb plug to charge your phone, better still an extension lead with usb sockets <br/>We took a cool box ( mains plug ) to keep beer and wine in as the fridge is too small for cans/ bottles.<br/>We also took a multi/slow cooker as only 2 gas burners so we were able to cook baked potatoes and a stew.<br/>Be prepared to walk a distance from the car, the wheel barrow came in handy to transport bags of logs and shopping bags<br/>No lock on patio door so take valuables with you if going out for the day.<br/>Take a torch it’s dark walking to the toilet and also pitch black if your walking from car park late at night. <br/>Visit the farm shop and buy local produced veg and meat<br/>Be aware the toilet is a compost and may not be to everyone taste and may be a bit smelly if the weather is warm. <br/>And most important enjoy the peace and quiet.",

We explored and spent a lot of quality time with our children. A great stay!<br/><br/>Worth noting that the compost toilet is clean and tidy but a little walk through the woods to get to. A little tricky at night time.<br/><br/>No curtains in the cottage but we didn't feel that privacy was affected at all. You really do feel out on your own in the woods - perfect for us! We didn't see anybody else whilst there. Nice and warm when we visited end of October and the log burner was great.<br/><br/>The only complaint we had was our main bed didn't feel fresh and clean and had a lot of loose dirt and stains on the mattress which we found on stripping the sheets at the end of our stay. Have mentioned this to the owner so that they can address this with their cleaner. A fresh bed with clean sheets can really make a 5 star review.",

And well kitted out with all you need in the kitchen. We loved exploring in the woods, lying in the hammocks in the willow grove, being quiet and cosy in front of the fire… lovely veg & meat from the farm shop available, and coast not far by car for some seaside walks. It’s exactly what it says it is, and it’s glorious… we would love to come back for more slow woodland respite :)",

Enjoy some peace and quiet in your own Instagram worthy treehouse, then borrow a skateboard from camp and cruise up to the perfect swimming spot in the river. Be wary of likely not having cell-service during your stay (1 of us had none, the other a little bit). The only negative for us was that the river bath was not available to use due to some fire hazard issues. Not a dealbreaker but don’t expect it if that’s what you are looking forward to. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone. It is very much like staying in an elevated tent so if you are comfortable with that, you will have a great time.",

The tree houses lie direct by the river and you can hear the sound of the water all the time. The equipment is simple, but you have everything you need (gas to cook little meals/coffee, water to wash). Highly recommended. Best stay of our honeymoon !",

    "about": "Hi! \n\nMy name is Isaac and with loads of help from family and friends, I have been building a place to experience the Norwegian nature in an authentic, simple and inexpensive way. The goal is to make a great place to camp, hang out and do different activities along the untouched river Tessungåe.\n\nI have developed a collection of small living spaces in tents, cabins and treehouses. The outdoor facilities are shared, and we have recently finished some great additions like heated bathtubs by the river and an outdoor kitchen. Next up: a sauna! It’s the perfect place to take a break from everyday life and meet new people from all over the world. There are a range of possibilities to explore nature, do exciting sports like kayaking and kiting, as well as discover great fishing and skiing spots.\n\nLooking forward to meeting you!",

From the views, to the waterfall that was viewable from our room, to the aroma. Everything was dreamy as can be. The staff was SO friendly and helpful. We were even able to rent a scooter from Kan in order to ride around Tulum! We were excited to visit Tulum again, but after visiting Kan, we have even more urgency to get back as soon as possible!",

The cenote is gorgeous and the breakfasts were so delicious. The staff was so friendly and made us feel at home. Great communication leading up to and throughout stay. Pro tip: it’s very eco friendly so if AC is important to you leave the blinds down and eco mode on throughout the day so when you get back from a long day out you can be cool. It’s about 15 min from a lot of the beach main destinations so we found renting a car to be ideal. Felt very safe here as two females traveling.",

Especially, with all these crazy things going on in the world. This place made it feel like there was nothing but peace. It definitely has a Bali vibes and I initially wanted to go there but because of COVID, they are not allowing tourist to come. However, Tulum made it possible and KAN made it even better. They have a beautiful cenote on site that in case you didn't want to go out to see one. There was one for you. <br/><br/>Everyone was so nice there! The way we communicated was through whatsapp. We made all transportation arrangements through there and it was well communicated. I would come back here again when visiting tulum. I kid you not. It was a peaceful experience!",

The view was amazing, very quiet place for the people who wants a silent & relaxing time.<br/><br/>Spending time around the pool is so fun, pool is quite large, bigger than we thought. <br/><br/>Also, the house has everything you might need, an oven, microwave, toaster, pans, blender etc. We found everything  we needed.<br/><br/>Hope we come and stay again Femke :)",

      "comments": "TDLR: 2 power outages left us wondering when the next would come. Moldy smell. Wifi was not working. If you can overcome these issues, I am sure you will have a blast, because even with our issues it was a worthwhile stay.<br/><br/>Soon after we arrived there was a power outage in the neighborhood. In the intense 30 degree Turkish night heat, we were forced to sleep outside. The host was very accommodating and brought a mosquito net and some lights to help in the dark, but even then the heat and the insanely loud crickets chirping all day and all night made for an unpleasant experience. The power finally came on at 1 in the morning at which point we could go sleep in the AC cooled bedroom. We wake up and the internet is now down, which is a quite important for us as we received no information about where to go shop or eat or anything in the surroundings. The internet didn't work for the remainder of the trip. Around lunch time, another power outage occurs and lasts for 2 hours, meaning we couldn't make our lunch from food we had bought the day before. The remainder of the trip we were worried that another power outage would occur.<br/><br/>The area takes 15 minutes to drive to, from the main road, through the most intense offroading I have ever experienced in a car - no asphalt, only gravel roads. So be prepared with water, food, and everything you need for your trip, ideally you shouldn't leave the premises unless necessary.<br/><br/>The house is beautiful, with an amazing terrace and pool, and looks very slick and modern. There was however a mold smell. Quite a good experience, unfortunately overshadowed by the looming possibility of another power outage.",

And after the power cut  the WiFi adaptor had to be restarted and it was working maybe you didn't get our message I'am sad for this.",

Sie hat uns auf der Hauptstraße abgeholt und zur Location gebracht. Die Location ist traumhaft. Auch gab sie sich sehr viel Mühe das Schlafzimmer mit Whirlpool für unsere Flitterwochen zu dekorieren mit Rosen und Kerzen. Ebenso hat sie uns ein leckeres Abendessen mit Nachttisch vorbereitet. Die Location war sauber und genau wie auf dem Bild zu sehen. Femke war regelmäßig erreichbar bei Fragen. <br/>Einziger Nachteil war dass der Strom ab und zu mal für paar Minuten ausging wenn man viele elektrische Geräte gleichzeitig an hatte.",

She picked us up on the main road and took us to the location. The location is fantastic. She also went out of her way to decorate the bedroom with hot tub for our honeymoon with roses and candles. She also prepared us a delicious dinner with a nightstand. The location was clean and exactly as shown in the picture. Femke was regularly available for questions. <br/>The only downside was that the power went out every now and then for a few minutes if you had many electrical appliances on at the same time.",

      "comments": "Balsa surf camp is a bohemian dream! Rasty (Cesar) and Julie have built a gem of a place in Montanita. The attention to detail is incredible and it is truly a one of a kind experience. We stayed in the VW bus and it was exactly as described. Because it is outdoors and we were there during the “overcast” season it was very humid and damp. One of the other units would be better for longer stays, but it was perfect for us the week we were there. The hosts are friendly and have thought of everything you might need. We appreciated the free filtered water and laundry service. There is security on grounds at night (not that we ever felt we needed it) and someone is always available should you need something. Complimentary breakfast each morning in the restaurant was delightful and the location is perfect for exploring the beach and nearby restaurants and bars. We loved Montanita so much that my boyfriend and I decided to rent an apartment and stay for a few months. I highly recommend our stay at Balsa and the fun surf town of Montanita.",

      "comments": "We loved this space! It was a vw bus with a patio just as described. It was very neat to stay in. We had originally planned a long term stay in the bus but after one night ended up switching rooms just for a little more comfort. I would recommend this room if you are staying one or two nights but any longer than that I would recommend one of balsa surf camps other rooms. Balsa surf camp is an amazing place, the location is perfect. It’s walking distance (recommend taking the beach) to the main strip of montanita, and there are other bars/restaurants along the way. It is located right of front of the best surf spot in montanita. I highly recommend this place and will definitely stay here again!",

The property it’s on is also so beautiful, with hammocks and lights and so many plants! It’s an oasis. Also I didn’t realize this by the photos, the van is up in a treehouse 🤩 seriously one of the coolest unique places I’ve ever stayed. I would definitely stay here again!! And they have yummy food at the restaurant:)",

Un lugar muy relajante, bastante alejado de la bulla del centro de Montañita, pero caminando se llega rápido ya sea por la playa o por la calle.  El desayuno que pagamos por un valor adicional delicioso y abundante.   Limpieza muy buena.   La experiencia de dormir en la VAN fue muy interesante  y el balcón bastante amplio y con una hamaca que hacía el complemento perfecto.   La atención excelente.  Nos quedamos tubo abajo en una de las llantas del carro y enseguida nos consiguieron ayuda.   El Restaurante donde sirven el desayuno es en una planta alta donde se aprecia todo, no cenamos ahí pero al carta se veía interesante, si el desayuno fue muy rico seguramente lo demás lo será.   Cenamos en un restaurante al frente como otra opción Shanka 👌🏻.   Sin pensarlo volveríamos.  Gracias por todo.",

        "comments": "Beautiful place.  Loved the sound of nature.  A very relaxing place, quite far from the buzz of downtown Montañita, but walking you can reach it quickly either by the beach or on the street.  The breakfast we pay for a delicious and abundant additional value. Very good cleanliness.   The experience of sleeping in the VAN was very interesting  and the balcony was quite spacious and with a hammock that made the perfect complement.   Excellent service.  We stayed downstairs in one of the tires of the car and they immediately got us help.   The restaurant where they serve breakfast is on a high floor where you can appreciate everything, we did not have dinner there but the menu looked interesting, if breakfast was very delicious, surely the rest will be.   We dined at a restaurant out front as another Shanka option👌🏻.   Without thinking we would come back.  Thank you for everything.",

Wonderful & friendly staff cleaned the rooms + pool every day & answered any questions quickly via WA. Nice shared pool & kitchen to mingle with other guests. I stayed during a rainy week, so the insects/frogs/geckos were a little loud sometimes - but I didn’t mind, it was all part of the “jungle” experience! Would recommend if you’re looking for a more unique but traditional Indonesian feel v.s. the modern/luxury villas & hotels in the area.",

As it is quite old and historic it does allow a few bugs to get in- which didn’t bother us as there was a great mosquito net around the bed. The pool and yoga studio were beautiful. We loved the yoga class with Daniella! Breakfast was healthy and delicious each morning with many other awesome Yummy food options to choose from through the day. We would definitely recommend this place to friends visiting Bali I’m the future!",

I would definitely stay here again! One thing to note are the bugs and creatures, but I'm from an immigrant family so we're used to living in the wild. :)",

I loved the 'jungle' setting and falling asleep to the sounds of nature (although, if you're not a fan of wildlife, this accommodation wouldn't be for you!). Brekkie options were fresh and tasty. The host can arrange airport pickup for a small fee too :) (Note: the steps to the Sumatran Karo House are very steep so it probably wouldn't be suitable for anyone with mobility issues.)",

It was a cozy cottage with all the necessary additions. The jacuzzi was easy to operate and had a beautiful view. Overall it was a very pleasant experience, however the road to the location is not suitable for low cars, as it was very steep and bumpy.",

      "comments": "These houses are perfect to stay for 1-2 weeks. Everything looks like the pictures show it, you get a cozy whirlpool (to heat up with wood) where you can relax & have a beautiful view over the hills of Poland. Every house has its own parking lot, its own staircase to a big terrace just for you. The house itself is almost entirely made out of wood, you have a little fireplace inside but you can also control the temperature on the floor digitally. There's also a TV with Netflix, Spofity, and more.<br/><br/>Hania was nice and available everytime , when we needed some help we wrote her a SMS and half an hour later (I guess) she sent some polite and helpful men to our door, that would give you more wood & more information.<br/><br/>The houses are placed like 20 meters apart but they're built in a specific way, the neighbours won't really see you.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a really recommendable place to relax -<br/><br/>& if you arrive in winter with your car, make sure you have snow-chains or a good engine with your car because the last 100 meters down to the houses have a steep descent which makes it very difficult to go back in the snow.",

The care and creativity they have poured into this magical, private spot is very obvious and make it a fun, comfortable, relaxing spot. The camper is (obviously) small but they have done a phenomenal job with the efficiency and usage of the space and we had everything we could have wanted/ needed. Very Impressive! <br/>We could not have had a better time and really hope to come back here!  <br/>Also, they were very attentive, communicative, and kind! Y’all are The best!",

A couple things to note, my husband is 6'1\" tall and until he got used to height kept hitting his head on low ceiling and the bed was very short for him. Outside shower was good for his height but could not use the indoor one.  Although the outdoor shower was great fun and we loved it.😉  During winter months would not have worked out so well. Also did have limited hot water available.  But we did have a great time and would recommend",

It is four floors and has a surprising amount of well-down exhibits. We had a great time with responsive hosts.",

Super close to any need in town yet truly remote and private with expansive views for all sorts of outdoor scenery.  <br/><br/>15 min drive to Pilot Mountain for long nature hikes and 3 minutes from several beautiful river-side walking trails!  <br/><br/>The bed was amazingly comfortable - HOT water with great pressure...really every amenity you could ask for while still that 'camping' feeling.  The outdoor swinging couch is one piece I miss the most, perfect for lounging and reading or even sleep out there under the stars!  I LOVED IT and will be back again and again!! So lucky to have found it and to meet Dennis & Ben - all gems and multiple five stars!  Thank you :)",

I brought two pre-teens and they enjoyed it a lot; they liked the river and beach, having some space to roam in, the playground on the other side of the river was nice, and the huge fire pit was great for a chilly night. The home is a converted camper (pretty much everything on site is reused), cozy and warm. I think the novelty might wear off on a long stay but two days while visiting family was quite comfortable. The price seems just a little steep to stay in a camper, not exactly luxurious (especially indoor shower is quite cramped), but the hosts are very thoughtful and generous, and it's a good location with a lot of character. Give it a try for something a little different.",

The location is right by downtown attractions but feels secluded and private. If you’re in search of something out of the ordinary, check this place out!",

Airy and the winding Granite Greenway, this Glamping retreat  offers fun and refreshing riverfront views and access to the Ararat with privacy and the \"illusion of seclusion\" .  The sandy beach, the rocked terrace and decking with it's picnic tables and really comfortable bed swing encouraged us to enjoy outdoors right there.  The night time uplighting in the trees is nothing less than spectacular.  We saw deer, turkey, and coyote right from our deck!",

In the summer you can cook outside BBQ or camping stove. Limited numbers of plates and cutlery with no washing facility. Lovely place in the middle of lovely countryside.",

The Hobbit Hole is just as described and the bed was possibly the softest, comfiest bed I've ever slept in. The birdsong and nature on a morning was the perfect accompaniment to a cup of fresh coffee. Just the most blissful place. I left feeling recharged and relaxed! <br/><br/>On top of this, Samantha and Simon were fantastic hosts - super helpful and attentive. There's nothing they wouldn't do. Thank you!",

The shower room is cold in winter but to be expected, quick jump in the shower so not a problem as we weren’t hanging around in there and this is glamping! Surroundings gorgeous, fab local pub and we loved Nantwich! Sam was a fab host, lovely little touches left for us and nothing seemed to be too much for her! Thank you!!",

There’s everything there that you could possibly need. It feels like a home away from home. We enjoyed our stay so much and will  certainly be back again soon! Thank you so much Sam and Simon, it was a pleasure to meet you and stay in your fantastic hobbit house!  🧙‍♂️",

Everything you could need was provided. We loved cooking on the outdoor grill and sat around the fire pit both nights listening to music and relaxing. Little touches inside and outside the hobbit hole showed just how much Sam & Simon value the comfort of their guests. The setting and wildlife are amazing. Look out for the giant tortoise and miniature shetland pony! Would recommend a visit to Audlem for breakfast, and the Bridgemere garden centre has the best butchers! We also visited the Boar’s Head for dinner, delicious! And alao Hack Green secret nuclear bunker which was fascinating. We cannot wait to stay again and make the most of this serene and beautiful location. 5 stars!!!! xx",

I don't always sleep well when I'm away but the beds are so snug and cosy that it wasn't an issue... at all. Spotlessly clean and tidy too. Never visited Cheshire before and would return just for the Snugburys Ice Cream experience (thanks for the info Hobbit Hosts!). 100% recommend this treat of an Airbnb.",

Couldnt have wanted anything more, private, homely and best of all we felt like royalty.  Birthday banner up for my partners birthday plus a lovely card. So much to do there, we did the local pub which was so friendly, Cheshire zoo which is an hour away on pretty stright wide roads, and ordered a really nice takeaway. We will 100% be back! Both me and my partner didn't want to leave! Next time i will be taking binoculars to watch the birds and wild life! Tiny tim (shetland pony) was awesome! And hes on your right leaving and entering, not to mention the gard puppies with there fluffy heads 😍  thank you sam your the best x",

The house itself is like something out of the films, with extra attention to detail ensuring you have everything you need. The bed was so comfortable, best sleep we've had in ages! Thank you so much again to Samantha and Simon, we can't wait to come back! Xx",

The first sign of sun was as I was loading my car to leave. I made the best of it with some baking and snuggling under a fleece. I thoroughly enjoyed one night by firing up the wood burner and watching TV. Next time I’ll check the weather forecast. I was just anxious to return. I have back problems and I’m guessing the weather caused that to flare up. Any problems I had while there were ones I brought with me! Kristen and Heather were still the best!",

We want to come back in Spring when everything is green! <br/>The place was very clean. It is very homey. It has everything you need to fully enjoy your time there. Having a fire in the fireplace in the living room was our favorite part of evenings. In spite of being a cabin in a very wooded area, it was nice and clean. Literally the only thing that did not look clean was the windows and it was from rain and elements. <br/>This place cannot disappoint. It is such a special house. Not sure it can be compared to any other! <br/>Our dog had a great time checking out the outdoors! We even had deer come up early AM one day",

There are other homes in the area so you are not isolated but you feel like you have the woods to your self. A fire pit, a platform overlooking the creek, great views for the multitude of windows and almost a fantasy feel to the place. I woke up in the middle of the night and dont know the last time i was somewhere that was that quiet. I loved it and the only complaint i have is that i did not plan on staying longer. I will be back.",

The unique design of the house makes it even more special.<br/>We loved our days at the mirror house. Also, the host was incredibly sweet. <br/>If you are looking for a relaxing vacation in a very private area this is the place to go to.",

      "comments": "We had a great 5 night-stay at both mirror houses (one for us and our 10 months old and one for the grandparents). The sleek design and the spacious open living room was perfect for our little guy to crawl around with not too many obstacles or hazards - and the same in the garden and pool area: he just loved the soft, well kept grass. The baby crib/travel bed was even set up with an extra mattress and cute baby towels were provided.<br/>We particularly enjoyed the private pool, the amazing view, the breeze in the morning by opening up the big sliding door and the skylights, and the feel of remoteness in the middle of the apple orchards while being able to walk to the grocery store and Salewa bivac for a snack or order pizza (pizza house st. Jakob - 30 min!). What a great location for a basecamp to explore Bolzano and the dolomites.",

The architecture is magnificent, and all the details were top notch - you can tell with the workmanship, the furniture, the guide book, and we noticed, even the key chain!  <br/><br/>We appreciated the hospitality and accommodation that the owners and caretakers extended to us to make it special. Sabina and Judith were so lovely and helpful, and made our stay even better.<br/><br/>We enjoyed the pool area during sunny days. It is truly, truly memorable, and have already recommended it to our friends.",

Firsts she asked to park my car straight skidding but I have a huge GL Mercedes and it did not fit to the parking lot and it was guide obvious to everyone. So I parked it in parallel. Than I asked for the cleaning lady to come once during our stay but she did not even change the sheets. And the cleaning cost 30 euro but I left 50 in the house hoping that she could return some change but she has taken all 50 euro. And check in procedure was quite long. ",

Staying at the Mirror Houses felt like staying at a luxury hotel, but with all the care and charm of a B&B. \r<br/>\r<br/>The house itself is amazing. And the location feels beautifully nestled amidst the mountains and the apple orchards.\r<br/>\r<br/>Sabine was super helpful with activity and restaurant recommendations and was even able to get us a reservation on a particularly busy weekend.\r<br/>\r<br/>Would love to come back!",

      "comments": "„Wow!“ That’s what we thought when we looked at the pictures in the web. And it was „Wow!“ again when we arrived at Mirror Houses.They ARE like they look on the photos. Great design, tasteful interior. At the same time cosy and comfortable. Hosts Sabina and Victoria gave us a warm welcome. They show up quickly if yo need something, without beeing obtrusive. Their newly published ‚City Guide’ contains interesting shopping and excursion tips in and around Bolzano. Getting there: The last three or four kilometres are a little adventurous, leading through industral areas – but when arriving in the middle of apple plantations you finally reach a place of calm and relaxation, surrounded by hundreds of apple trees. \r<br/>Bernd & Christine",

We sat by the fire under the stars which was really unforgettable. She made us a lovely traditional breakfast before her friend dropped us at Little Petra to take the back route to see the Monastery. A must do if you’re visiting Petra, so much more memorable than a night in a hotel!",

They let as take a shower at there (as there is no shower or toilet at the cave) and then they drove us to the cave which is around 5-10km outside their village. The cave was very nice and cosy. It was really warm even it just had around 10degrees outside. Jamleh and her husband stayed there overnight too in the cave next to ours. We had a lovely dinner together and enjoyed the quiet scenery as it is really remote with no electricity, phone signal or running water. It was an experience you don't have too often nowadays. Thanks for having us, we really enjoyed it :).",

Her son greeted us on arrival at their family house, which is the address indicated for checking in. You’ll go to the cave later on, which is a 10min drive from the village house. The road is bumpy for the last 5min, but nothing to worry about. Network works smoothly in the village, but you won’t have any connection in the cave because it is too remote in the mountains. Nevertheless, this gives you the opportunity to experience the Bedouin lifestyle to the fullest. In fact, Jamleh will ensure you feel at ease at all times despite not speaking English and relying on her son to communicate. She will prepare a delicious breakfast for you, at your preferred time. Home cooked dinner can be arranged on request, and we can only recommend it. <br/>When it comes to visiting Petra, you still need to drive about 20min to reach the entrance of the area, yet the drive is surrounded by a beautiful scenery. <br/>I wouldn’t know how to describe how happy and touched we were to meet these people and to have a chance to live at their place. <br/>Living in a cave is a unique experience, and Jamleh made it exceptional.",

We stayed for two nights and got instantly integrated into their family and never felt uncomfortable at any time. The traditional food was so delicious and the cave was very cozy. After dinner we were sitting all together at the fire, talking and drinking cay. Me personally would recommend this location to all my friends which are going to visit Jordan or especially Petra.",

      "comments": "Overall it ended up being a relaxing couple of days.  <br/><br/>Pros: Neat house, very unique, loved the hot tub and super high tech toilet.  Saw owls, song birds, and lots of deer.  The location is peaceful and quiet.  The patio in the rain was heaven.  Robes were great, beds comfortable, the lighting is fantastic, and the fairy garden was a cute addition my daughter loved.  <br/><br/>Cons: the outdoor shower was broken and we had no prior notice (a huge selling point for my daughter).  There’s no stove top which is advertised, but the grill top was a disgusting mess and there was no scrubbing brush or cleaner for the stove.  I called Cheryl and Kenny and they sent a cleaning team over. Cheryl was rude when I brought these things to her attention and got short with me.  The bathtub (our only means to bathe) had a small hot water heater and ran out quickly.  Lastly, I felt very uneasy in a cloth house with easy access on the west side and just below the balcony.  Ultimately. I felt exposed.",

      "response": "This guest was given a full nightly refund of $770 for his two nights.  I wonder why he did not open with that part of the stay? Or that one of the main rules of our property is no children under 10. Getth reached out to me early in the morning concerning the shower that was not functioning.  The shower mixer had broken the stay before and we did not have time to replace with a new unit.  I apologized. Then he began discussing how his 3 year old was so disappointed.  I told him that NO CHILDREN are allowed at the Nest under 10.  He asked me to call him and we began our discussion that did not go well.  First he complained that there was  no cooktop inside the tent.  I explained we designed that on purpose as cooking grease and smells cling to the material ceiling of the tent, so we provided a side cooker on our bbq grill outside.  It is glamping. We also have the oven, instapot, and a microwave.  This was not satisfactory for Getth.  He then moved to the grill, and yes it was a mess.  This was completely our fault and I immediately offered to pay for his family to go to a great breakfast restaurant while the cleaning crew came to address the grill.  Getth did not want to leave and Getth did not want us to clean the grill. He then indicated the propane tank was empty, which we knew was not, but we bought an extra one and the cleaning crew brought it to the Nest.  Getth DID let us clean the grill once we were there. On our call he began reciting the Airbnb page and finally came to the part about the no children rule (whoops, he just missed that part).  Then he wanted to know why there was no lake access?  There has never been lake access at the Nest. He then went on and on about having too many rules.  It was all just so wrong for him and he was threatening that he wanted compensation for the shower and the dirty grill. I was fine with that, but after much verbal abuse, I had had enough of Mr. Getth.  I just refunded his nightly rate completely.  Funny, after that he became very thankful and docile.  We have had over 300 guests stay here and I have never had anyone complain about a \"small\" hot water tank.  This is the first I have heard that he felt \"exposed\" being in a cloth house.  The Nest is a tent after all.  I have been doing this for over 12 years and we continually try and make all the details better and fix any one of them that is a problem or an issue.  We respond as quickly as we can to any concern, but we could not please this guest.  Nothing was going to make it better, not even a full refund. We truly want our guests to be close to nature while having luxury amenities.  It is a balancing act and we fail sometimes like all humans, but having a guest berate you when you are trying everything you can do and still it just isn't enough is hard to take.",

It was well stocked and the jacuzzi was nice even though it was cold outside. We found some<br/>nice places to eat and it wasnt too far off the beaten path that the drive into town was long. <br/>The property manager is extremely responsive. We had a small issue and he responded within minutes. <br/>Cons: Because it’s a tent, expect outside noises to carry. Think leaf blowers, birds, basically any noise from outside. The location was secluded so this wasn’t too bad but the neighbors are really into leaf blowing. Lol. <br/>The glass doors let in light and it’s a little disconcerting when sleeping at night because they aren’t covered. But the locked entryway into the deck made us feel safer. <br/>Lastly, it's a small thing but the floors arent even. <br/>Overall we enjoyed our stay and have recommended The Nest to friends.",

We strive to give an ultra luxury experience while bringing you close to nature. Due to the drought this year followed by a lot of rain, we have had some settling and that has caused some fit issues.  We have these slated to be addressed in the spring.  Thanks for your feedback and I hope you will also check out our new tents in Hot Springs that will be open spring of 23.  They will be called The Covey.  Private stocked pond, and no leaf blowers near!  God Bless, Cheryl",

Thank you so much :) <br/>We will be for sure back to cotignac and hopefully to this museum-house that our 16 month son so much enjoyed! :)",

Would not recommend for people with mobility issues, but this is clearly stated from the beginning. The bedrooms are very cosy, the personal touch all over the house is wonderful.<br/>Highly recommend this place!",

      "comments": "Trip highlight! If you’re looking for a unique stay this is it. The cave house is about as 5-star as you can get for holes-in-rocks accommodation. It is quirky and weird and all kinds of wonderful. But, you need to be up for a challenge! There are 40 crazy uneven twisty steps with a rope railing between the top floor (amazingly neat) bedroom and the ground level bathroom. There isn’t a level floor in the entire place. You have to duck and manoeuvre to get into some of the rooms. And by rooms I mean grottos. It’s all part of the charm but not for little children or anyone with balance or mobility issues. The pathway to the front door was a little challenging. The drive in to the village was a bit dodgy but the parking lot was roomy and level (you’ll appreciate the juxtaposition of this statement if you come). We were greeted by a lovely host with  friendly welcome and great suggestions for nearby sights. We read that wifi was a challenge here - supposed to be better outside the front door but we didn’t get the password so can’t confirm or deny this claim. The village was charming. Lots of restaurants. The views of and from the troglodyte house were spectacular. This stay was like living a part of history. If ever there was a time when you wished “if only these walls could talk” this is it.",

Note to budding Rachmaninovs: don’t expect wonders from the piano…",

We had a BMW as a hire car and it was a bit low for the roads in town, there were some tight corners on steep hills. A normal 4 door hatch back would be fine 👌🏻 Enjoy.",

      "comments": "One of the most unique Airbnb’s in the world! Found in the quaint village of Cotignac, it has everything you need. It was very difficult for my partner and I to leave, we could have stayed for another few days. We loved its quirky character, its history and the beautiful location most.<br/><br/>The home was thoughtfully stocked with cooking utensils, crockery and cutlery. While the kitchen is very small, you may find eating in the village of Cotignac (only a few hundred meters away) more convenient. We made breakfast for ourselves in the little space without too many issues. Dinners in Cotignac were superb. <br/><br/>The beds were comfortable, and the home is interestingly decorated. It gets a little warm at night (we visited in high summer), and there is no modern air conditioning. A couple of electric fans are provided.<br/><br/>Be aware that it is a very old house built against a cliff, so it isn’t child-friendly; some of the ceilings and stairs can be a little dangerous if you don’t pay attention. <br/><br/>The Côtes de Provence area is wonderful with many great wines and fantastic food, and has many interesting towns and villages all around.",

      "comments": "This is probably the most beautiful and unique Airbnb I ever stayed at, it feels like staying in an old castle tower with back walls of cave. The rooms are wonderful, the decorations and furniture so tasteful and the building architecture combines with the cave wall in beautiful ways .  From the kitchen you have a wonderful view of the village and the landscape beyond. It is very vertical and stairs in between every room, you definitely get a workout staying here. We stayed during the hottest summer yet, and the top bedroom got very hot. Every other room was great though and fans are provided. We also couldn't connect to wifi, but managed without for a few days. We really enjoyed our stay here, what an unforgettable experience. Merci!",

      "comments": "This airbnb is truly an experience! Me and my sister loved our stay here. Besides the cave house being a treat, the town of Cotignac was what won our hearts over in the end! Such a great town with so much history, artists, and good food. We loved how the home was decorated and the place truly had everything you would ever need in an airbnb, there was quite a few spiderwebs but kind of inevitable when in a cave. We had a problem with our wifi but honestly we just ended up getting a french SIM card at the Tabac store and our problem was solved! We were too busy each day to have even used the wifi at the unit, this is definitely not a complaint just a heads up if you're expecting this place have A+ wifi.  This place is definitely worth the trip, for the character and history of the unit but also for the character and history of the town!",

Me and 7 friends came down to get some time together for the holidays and it was just the getaway that we needed. We stayed in and cooked all of our meals and the kitchen was stocked with all of the dishes and utensils we needed for each meal. A great place to gather. Lots of daylight thru the windows made for great moods and good energy! Definitely saving to my favorites for another stay when the weather warms up!<br/> Check in was easy and communication was great!",

Everything we needed was there and the house itself is just incredible. We had a larger group of 8 guys and everyone slept comfortably, tons of space, and no issues at all.<br/><br/>Would 100% recommend this house to friends and would 100% stay there again in the future. It's super close to so many great spots on the lake, too. Definitely make sure you rent a car for the weekend (don't rely on Uber) and plan ahead for food. There are still grocery stores and restaurants in a commutable distance, but just better to plan ahead. We still were able to get Postmates out there (just took a bit longer). No issues, though.",

First the day we arrived the AC was turned off and the house was 87 degrees inside. It took almost 7 hours to get the house cooled down making the first full day we were there kind of wasted. This is Texas and summers are notorious for being hot. I would highly recommend the days the house has guests for check in that the AC be turned on early in the morning so the house is comfortable when guests arrive. Also to note is that at check in we were told that the AC in the master bedroom did not work. This is by far the nicest room in the house and sleeping in there was very difficult. If the AC was not working we should have been told in advance and/or offered some discount. This house was not cheap. <br/><br/>This house has great views and lots of doors and windows. One thing that was a bit frustrating was that many of the doors on lower level and one of the doors on the main floor had blue tape on them and a sign saying do not use. I can understand maybe having 1 or 2 areas of the house where you don't want guests to use but there were just too many. The most frustrating was the door that went straight to the driveway was blocked off which meant every time we had to go up the stairs to get in. It would have been nice to come straight to the lower level from the parking area. The lower level kitchen was also off limits and was not complete. It looked like it is just unfinished but it did not look like it was being worked on. There was no mention of this or any pics on the listing. <br/><br/>Last major issue was there were tons of cockroaches in the house especially on the lower level. We even found a huge dusty area in the window with cockroaches. We stayed 2 nights for an average of $1250 a night. I believe the cleaning fee was around $250 and for that kind of cleaning fee the house should have been way cleaner. The lower level specifically had tons of areas that were dusty. The doors and windows were not cleaned and we found cockroaches in many places. I would recommend they use a pest control company on the regular because of the location. Finally most of the dishes we had to re-wash before using. <br/><br/>It was all not bad, the host did communicate very well and respond to any questions very quickly. The location is amazing, and the house is beautiful. Very spacious and tons of room for activities and fun with a small group. The lookout at the top of the third floor is super cool with amazing views especially at sunset. <br/><br/>I am writing this review only in the hopes a few things are done better to make this house worth the price. I am not a big AirBnb renter but I have had a few and stayed in many with friends on their rentals and have rarely had any of the issues above if ever. I rarely write long reviews like this, only trying to provide constructive criticism.",

Of the 100 positive aspects of the place from the stunning interior to the location near Lake Travis, the 1 downside is the 30-45 min drive to downtown Austin. The place provided more than enough room for our 11 guests. Highly recommend staying here.",

      "comments": "In summary, I definitely don’t feel like I stayed at a luxurious home worth the cost of my trip.  This home was by far the dirtiest places I’ve stayed at.  It was also not adequately stocked particularly if you plan on staying at the home for most of the stay.  I’ve traveled to many Airbnbs for work and for vacation, and had a wonderful time in other places and have given 5 star reviews, and all my reviews are equally positive.  I don’t consider myself high maintenance, and from all my positive reviews, it seems to be the case.  However, I feel the need to write this as it would be unfair for any future guests.  I’ve never had to contact any owner as often as I did on this trip.  I left feeling disappointed and just wished we stayed at a hotel, particularly after comparing this vacation home to the ones we’ve stayed at in Newport Beach or Yosemite.  Details below.  <br/>With cleaning fee of $250, the place should be spotless, but we found remnants of m&m candies from previous guests on the rugs, debris in the corners of rooms, and spider webs everywhere… particularly on the ledges where there are funko pops.  <br/>There are 3 bathrooms in this home.  As a note, when taking a shower, if you’re bringing a large group and wanting a warm/hot shower, you cannot shower using all bathrooms.  Within 5-10 minutes, if all showers are being used, the water will turn cold.   <br/>There is also only one hairdryer for the entire place.  I messaged the owner to ask to see if there were more.  He only provides one which I did note that it’s unfortunate since they already knew there were 9 of us staying.  We had to take turns using it which was very inconvenient.  <br/>I’ve never stayed in a place where I felt that I had to carefully use paper towels, toilet paper, and towels.  <br/>Their cleaning lady left only 1/2 roll of paper towel for us in the kitchen.  We had to resort to using a roll we brought. You are charged an occupancy fee for extra guests which I understood and didn’t mind paying.  However, there just isn’t enough supplies for everyone.  For our reservation of 9 people, the total occupancy fee and taxes was $1059.70.  This is in addition to the cleaning fee, service fee, and cost per night.  Our stay for 3 nights was over $4,000.  <br/>There is only enough towels for each person to have one hand towel and one full size towel.  Due to the very modern open concept that extends to the bathroom, it’s inevitable for water to come out of the shower area because there is no glass door.  We had 4 elderly family members with us, and had to mop the floors in fear of them slipping when going to the bathroom.  There was certainly not enough towels for this.  (We don’t have young children.  No one was splashing water intentionally.) <br/>I did bring this to the attention of the owner prior to writing this review beforehand, and finally, they did give us the code to the storage closet to which we were able to get more paper towels, toilet paper, and towels.  Sadly, though they didn’t give us the code when I complained the first day… Only on the last day were we given access, so we were rationing toilet paper and paper towels for most of our stay.  <br/>He makes a long list of things that can/can’t be done.  I didn’t think much of it at first, but now I realize the owner must have had some rough guests who left the place in terrible condition.  Because the owner isn’t local, the place is managed from afar and sadly, their cleaning crew is one of the worst.  It just didn’t have the care and concern of an owner who stays nearby or a very good property manager.<br/>Finally, I will say the home is beautiful in photos and will look great for any social media influencers.  However, take note that the house is unfinished.  There are areas not included in these photos that have yet to be completed.  Including the downstairs kitchen.  The owner does disclose that guests cannot use it.  (Not that we wanted to use the lower kitchen, we were just surprised that at this price point, it is not only not useable, it is rusted with large holes in the cabinets.). The downstairs bathroom is also not redone which is not included in the photos shown.  <br/>Once again, at this price point, this is supposedly a luxury experience with so much potential.  Sadly, we didn’t have that experience.",

      "response": "We will take Tiffany's feedback into account and try to improve where we can however Tiffany was the most high maintenance guest we ever had. There was simply no please her. She complained about spiderwebs on skylights, that she couldn't find the dinner plates because she didn't pull the drawers out far enough to see it in the back, and that she ran out of towels because she used them to soak up water after the shower. She constantly messaged us to complain and ask for things throughout the entire weekend so much so that we had to give her access to the locked supply closet just to appease her.  I Would say that her expectations are more in line with staying at a 5 star resort with 24 hour service which is not a reasonable expectation for an Airbnb in the hill country. Based on the overwhelming amount of positive reviews we have I think Tiffany's experience was more impacted from her unreasonable expectation that we simply could not meet rather then the actual intended experience we provided. I would not recommend hosting her as a guest again for these reasons.",

You are awakened naturally by the birds chirping.<br/><br/>Nattakitt’s units are lovingly cared for as evidenced by the cleanliness and thoughtfulness of the amenities provided. The hosts truly want you to have an exceptional stay. We loved the softness of the bamboo sheets and simplicity of the unit. <br/><br/>While it didn’t bother us, do know that the property is in the flight path to the airport so you can periodically hear airplanes. There is also a barking dog nearby.<br/><br/>We loved our stay and hope to return again in the near future!",

I ended up being in crutches for the majority of my stay but one of the lovely staff actually tiled me a separate little walk way so I could crutch to my house more easily. That sort of kindness and attention to detail won’t go unforgotten. My friends and I felt right at home here :)  also shout out to the great Japanese restaurant next door! They have Asahi on draft and amazing food :)!",

The views are spectacular and the presence of nature is beautiful. 💖<br/>I ended up leaving earlier than planned because I did not realise the challenge of transport. Still so thankful for having seen this side of Cali.",

The amenities are minimal (but everything you need it still there), but it really makes you value the location, and it makes you want to take a break from the real world. Rain or shine, the location is awesome. The host set us up with a driver who was very nice and super reliable and helpful. Make sure to set up that contact, as you will need a driver to get to and from the city/Airbnb. We went hiking from the Airbnb and ask the host for suggestions and she gave us great ones, so definitely ask the host for things to do nearby! Loved the view and all the windows so much, waking up in the clouds with only the sun and no alarms on my phone was a dream come true.",

I would really suggest making a deal with a driver to get there and after you leave. It was a bit of a hassle on the day of checkout. Also have extra blankets because it does get cold at night. There wasn’t any hot water, but that was expected being up in the mountains. It was a great place to disconnect from the city. I would stay there again!",

It looks exactly like the pictures, if not more beautiful! <br/>It is very remote and took us over 2 hours from Ubud which we didn’t realise. <br/>Also the warnings about bugs were very right and there were lots of them. So be prepared for this as well as lizards and other animals entering the room at night time. <br/>The staff were absolutely amazing and so friendly. The food was good and it came very fast every time. We loved using their scooter for the day to get to the waterfall close by. We went to the waterfall on our own by scooter and it was easy to find using maps and following the signs through the beautiful rice fields (took around 15minutes). <br/>Thank you to hideout for our stay!",

      "comments": "Lovely stay at Lightroom. This house has a unique location with a huge garden along the river which set for the perfect atmosphere for total relaxation. I think the location for Lightroom  is actually the best. <br/>However there was a few things that made the place not get a 5 from us. People could see into our house and garden from outside , we thought it would be more private. The food for dinner was very disappointing and tasteless, the worst meal we had for 3,5 weeks in Bali. Disappointing when the price is high. Also on IG you get the impression that they are there for you with a lot of tips on what to do in the area but when we asked the privately they didn’t have any specific tips so we had to find out this ourself <br/><br/>It’s such a good experience to drive around the area with scooter (which you rent for free at the property) and see the rural and local life of balinese people and really impressive nature. Sidemen area is one of my faves and I’ve been all over Bali! <br/>Thanks for the stay hideout ❤️",

Dan and Miku are great hosts with a true passion for off-grid living. Even though it was wet and rainy, I had a wonderful time strolling around the farm and down the hiking trail. <br/><br/>I stayed in the Hobbit Hole, and a hole it was indeed. It was slightly damp and there were a few friends crawling on the wall, but apart from those (very expected) drawbacks, it was an adorable stay. The wood-burning stove warmed the place up very quickly and kept it comfortable all night. <br/><br/>I also LOVED the steam sauna!",

Bring some flashlights, camping lanterns, etc. Parking lot is at the bottom of the hill and requires walking up a steep dirt/rock road to your place. You can drive to drop off your stuff, but can’t leave your car there. Not a major issue. Try to get there during the daytime, it’s dark back there at night.",

Those people read the description, which says that we are out on the wilderness and a working farm AND you're likely to see a wood chip pile for mulch, weeds (as we live in the forest), and other farming projects\r<br/>\r<br/>I'll also mention, for the sake of clarity, that we clean this Hobbit Hole daily.

Unfortunately, upon arrival, our excitement waned a bit.<br/> <br/>The road getting in should be improved quite a bit.  We were told any car can make the journey but we were VERY glad not to have a sedan or smaller car as it was slow moving due to the condition of the road. It was very uneven & there were trees down & barely cleared out of the way (we scratched up the side of our rental car in one section!).<br/> <br/>Once we came upon the Hobbit Hole we had mixed emotions.  It is a very cool idea to build into the mountain but the interior seems to have never been cleaned & there is barely any ventilation. Maybe a solar power ceiling fan would help?  We walked the property, checked out the bathhouse, other stays & greenhouse.  We understand it is a small community of people maintaining the land & hope that one day they put a little more attention to detail into the areas renters will be using for cleanliness & ease of accessibility.",

A banheira é quente e deliciosa. Tive apenas um probleminha no check out que como estava muita chuva a trilha para chegar até a casa apresentou muito barro o que fez meu carro atolar, porém o Leandro sempre muito acessível e tranquilo me ajudou resolver chamando o caseiro que inclusive foi ótimo. <br/>Recomendo sem duvidas!",

Como você deve ter visto, as câmeras são sempre voltadas para o exterior e podem ser visualizadas pelo hóspede a qualquer momento. Ainda assim indicamos no Manual da Casa  que as imagens são preservadas somente 7 dias para o caso de algum incidente  e também  damos a possibilidade de desativar o conjunto durante a estadia para maior privacidade. Dê uma olhada no Manual e na próxima vez que vier não hesite em fazê-lo.",

As for cameras, it was the solution we found to provide some security and avoid unpleasant architectural elements by looking like high walls and other barriers in such a beautiful and natural context. As you may have seen, the cameras are always looking outdoors and can be viewed by the guest at any time. Still, we indicate in the House Manual that the images are preserved only 7 days in case of any incident  and we also  give the possibility of deactivating the set during the stay for greater privacy. Take a look at the Handbook and the next time you come feel free to do so."

There is a lot of open nature around, and even a small forest where you can walk directly from the treehouse. All the amenities you might need for your stay in the house and the host lives just around the corner to help you with anything anytime. <br/><br/>Kris also helped us with the fireplace and let us invite our friends to join us for a few hours to enjoy the bonfire. <br/><br/>One small issue during warm months is that the house can get quite warm (it was 29-30 degrees) during our stay and due to the lack of windows in the house (except one in the bathroom) - we had a bit of an issue with ventilation - so we kept the entrance door open the whole night (yes, you're safe - as it's pretty isolated) - so it worked out well, but just a small thing to note.<br/><br/>I can highly recommend this place to anyone - it's a great place to spend a very relaxed weekend.",

The hosts were extremely lovely, helpful and available at all times. They answered all questions immediately and offered to make a fire at night. The view from the tree house into the near forest is lovely and I had a couple of beautiful inspiring walks. The piece of land includes the host‘s house and two tree houses and the interaction was very friendly and helpful. Definitely a five-star stay!",

Wasn’t too sure how to work the TV and no tips were given at all . So if you’re not to savvy with things like that , be ready to use your phone .. all my friends were envious I got to spend time in the hobbit house as they called it ! So while accommodations were good , Justin didn’t respond until 2 hours after I texted him that I got there as I got a bit flustered and concerned I would not find it ..but the pics were good and it was easy to locate this particular house bc there were a few little homes around it . <br/>All In all I enjoyed my stay and definitely recommend if you want your Lord of the ring friends jealous!! 😂",

Be warned you need to be smaller to stay in the tiny home. we had no problems as we are only 5 feet tall. haha otherwise we enjoyed everything and all was well stocked. Internet was spotty at times, but we managed. Spent more time in town anyhow, rather than inside all day. Definitely worth checking out this unique cute experience. Would stay again. thank you to the hosts!",

The design, location and community is super charming, the kitchen had everything we needed for a short stay, the bed comfy.<br/><br/>I brought wood , firestarter and a lighter for the firpit which was clutch but there was scrap pieces and a lighter already on deck which was nice. I’d recommend still bringing more if you want to chill by the fire for a while, we stayed outside and ate dinner in 30 degree weather or maybe lower and stayed nice and warm for hours.<br/><br/>Loved this place and would definitely come again. <br/><br/>The host was accommodating as well and super communicative.",

It’s only minutes away from the hustle and bustle of Pigeon Forge, but far enough that you feel nestled in the mountains. Great Wi-Fi! Very easy check-in and checkout! Justin was very quick with all the responses, and was very accommodating when I needed to adjust the reservation days. My boyfriend is 6’4” — he had to duck to move through parts of the home, but it didn’t bother him at all. Just wanted to put it out there, if you’re 6’4” or taller, it’ll be a tight fit BUT Justin did tell us that before we booked so I appreciated the honesty! Can’t say enough good things about my experience! Go ahead and book it!",

We have 5 tiny houses finished and ready for guests to enjoy...another 6 are on the way!\n\nOutside of tiny houses, we like to travel, learn about new cultures and languages,  landscape and familiarize ourselves with the latest technologies.

The instructions given by the host are spot on , making the trip logistics seamless if you follow them. As they mention, bring some soap and shampoo if you need, some plastic silverware and a couple yeti cups go a long way as well. We also brought a small Bluetooth speaker. This is such a unique experience and we had a wonderful time. <br/>The second afternoon we stayed, there was some kind of issue with the septic tank which created a bit of a smell. After sending someone out immediately to check it, the issue was acknowledged and the host sent me a partial refund for the inconvenience. Although this was not an ideal way to end our trip, I thought it was handled professionally by the host. This is a unique experience that does the mind, body, and soul good. If you have the means, I highly recommend a stay.",

The place is clean and everything you could NEED is there. The hosts respond immediately and are so gracious and helpful.  While you’re staying onboard you need to use their transportation company which is the only negative thing I have to say.  The price for a 3.5min boat ride they compare to the price of a plane ride on the website- and if you’re a decent person you should tip.   We stayed for a few days and unfortunately my friend got sick and I had to go into town each day. I think it’s completely understandable to have to pay for any trip you make during the duration of your stay- plus tip for host operators- but I don’t love that you’re expected to pay for transportation to and from the dock on the days you check in and check out.  We also waited until noon for our ship to shore shuttle the day we left after being told we had to depart by 11 and there was no late check out. We were packed and fully clothed on the deck for an hour. All said and done the small hiccups we’re exactly that and I would stay again in a heartbeat. ❤️",

      "comments": "Property and views - we stayed in A frame property, the cabins were nice with a great view.<br/>Cleanliness and hygiene - washroom was too small and there is no partition between toilet and shower and there is no dry area to change the clothes as it was the glass cabin. Also, there were many stray dogs in the property, one of them was lying on the bed.<br/>Way to reach the property- the roads to reach till mateura village is a complete off road and it is very difficult to ride private cars. There is a good 15 mins hike once you park the car at the Chandra cafe down.<br/>And there are no sign boards and lights to reach to the property. It is very very difficult to go up at the night.<br/>Service - yogi was the manager at the property who was managing it very poorly.<br/>We ordered tea and fries via WhatsAp and it came after two hours and that to after multiple calls. You have to be dependent on them for food once you are up as there are no options around and you can not go down very frequently. There is no centralised svstem to order food and no one is around the property constantly. We came back at 10 pm and there was no one to pick us up even after calling multiple times to the manager. We also communicated about early check out at 5 am to the manager and even after calling him multiple times, he did not wake up and we came down with 6 dogs in the early morning. Yogi just talks sweetly but doesn't really do anything. Though other support staff, Rahul and Rohit were very helpful.<br/>This property is ideal for couples but not for families or group of friends.",

Also no guidelines were provided on how steep a walk /trek it would be to get up to the actual rooms. Maybe pictures can be provided to give potential guests an idea.",

      "comments": "The stay was absolutely mind-boggling!!<br/><br/>Tanu and Team were really great, we received all the necessary details beforehand. The food was really good as well. The trek to the cabin can be a bit taxing since its pretty steep (which has already been mentioned in all communications by Rachana) so be prepared accordingly. Rest assured, this place is perfect for one night since you really cant do an up & down if you're planning to go to Kasol etc. They also have a dome and 2 other similar properties in the same area so do check out Rachana's Listings for the same!<br/><br/>Thank you for the  wonderful Experience Rachana! Look forward to visiting again!",

The transparent roof and glass windows on 3 sides made it a very unique experience. One of the highlights of our stay was looking at double rainbows which were visible from quite some time after a light shower.<br/><br/>The staff was very courteous and warm. They were ready to help with all our requests. The only place where there could be a little improvement was the food.",

Reaching the property needs additional cab to a start point of the Trek (yes, needs a 15-20 min hike) the cab is going to cost you 300/- one way (couple) if you’re a group of 4 it’ll require 2 cars so double the fare. <br/>2.

Satnam Ji was available all day to answer our many calls and questions, right from the moment we landed in Chandigarh. The day before we were supposed to check in, it had snowed in Jari (very rare for Jari). This made the last stretch of the trip more difficult - we needed to hike the last bit in snow (~15 minute hike in the snow - definitely was a little tricky but you're unlikely to encounter snow like we did). However, the staff helped us with our luggage and guided us to the airbnb. However, the hike was worth it! The airbnb was beautiful and overlooked snowcapped mountains all around. The food was great, and prepared at our convenience and according to our liking and delivered to the cabin. Overall a great experience :) <br/><br/>Heads up for anyone traveling in the winter - it definitely gets very cold inside, even with the space heater in the cabin and heated blankets in the bedroom tents. Also, the cabin and bathroom are much smaller than pictured which is good to keep in mind.",

Try and travel light, but carry sufficient warm clothing.<br/><br/>The views are spectacular! You go to bed under a blanket of stars and wake up to a glorious view of snow capped mountains.<br/><br/>Ideal for couples and friends alike, the Cabin is beyond anything you can imagine. The Host and her staff are very helpful and always ready to offer any assistance while giving you complete privacy. The food is really good as well, be prepared for a brief wait time, but the wait is worth it. <br/><br/>Can't help but fall in love with the Itsy Bitsy Cabin, just like my friends and I did! <br/><br/>Thanks Rachana for having us and all the best with property! <br/><br/><br/>On a side note, there's a Taxi Union in Jari that seem to like making a nuisance of themselves. So please be extra careful while dealing with Taxis from that area and outside areas. We brought in a taxi from Manali and because our Taxi was not part of their Union they refused to let it move unless we paid a Union Tax of Rs. 2000/-. Quite the extortionists.",

We loved stepping back from the busyness of Ubud to the peaceful setting of Firefly.<br/>The Firefly team are really friendly and helpful, a scooter was available to hire and the food options were great too! <br/>Would definitely recommend to people looking for a slightly different place to stay.",

      "comments": "We stayed in the eco cottage, which was quite clearly described as a more natural and humble experience during the booking process.<br/>The room looks amazing when you arrive and is just like the pictures. As mentioned, it is quite small and simplistic and can become a little cluttered if you have large bags, but we understand that is part of the experience/minimilistic approach.<br/>The shower has an open roof which was no problem for us, as it was quite warm during our stay, and it doesnt compromise privacy in any way. The only thing i felt the room was missing was maybe a sunbed or comfortable chair outside, as the two beanbags provided were a bit flat and uncomfortable. I understand this again with the overall minimilast approach.<br/>The room is quite far from the other room types, with locking gates on each side. One gate being closer to the main road so you can access the room directly. So it is quite private.<br/>All the staff are friendly and helpful if you need anything.",

      "comments": "The information Firefly shares about this listing is excellent. It helped me going in knowing to expect this was not in the heart of ubud (but easily walkable) and about the paths with steep drops. The stairs around firefly are quite tall, so if you don’t like stairs or are unsteady on your feet, please take note. I just took it slow and steady around the place, sturdy footwear helps too! <br/>The cottage was a nice base for a few days and listening to the crickets at night and living in nature was challenging at times but ultimately rewarding. I felt very well rested. The outdoor shower and bathroom were lovely. Recommend bug spray if you are probe to being bitten and a torch for night. Service is friendly and helpful.",

They are located right outside of center city, but it feels like you are in the middle of nowhere (PERFECT). Everything on the property is made of recycled materials and the whole energy is very artistic! There's a bar, a delicious restaurant, a beautiful pool, a swing and some really comfortable seating available 24/7 in the lobby. They also offer incredible messages! Every time we had a pick up, someone was willing to escort us to the front of the property by bike (even at 2am for our sunrise trek!) The most helpful and warm staff. I cant wait to return to the property in the future :)",

We try our hardest to prevent this by providing detailed directions (both written and a photo) in our House Info, and sending a message to guests requesting that they review the directions prior to their trip. We also send our phone number beforehand so that guests can reach out with any questions should they get lost or have any other issues. We wish we could have helped you avoid this issue, but we’re so glad that you enjoyed your stay overall!",

We had severe rain, a 24hrs power outage, therefore no WiFi and poor cell signal and only two candles and one box of matches to light our first night. When we asked for more candles, we were promised some and none came. On the one hand you feel like, ok we can get through this, it’s fine, on the other hand, our food was getting warm, we had no power and no support. Even with two SA cell phones. We were stuck in extreme weather and would not suggest going there in bad weather!",

      "response": "Hi Laura, shame you really did arrive in a major weather crisis, which made our national news! If I could have moved mountains and changed the weather for you, I would have. But 100's of kms of SA countryside was without power for 24hrs over that night following a major electric storm. We were happy with free cancellation, suggested alternative accommodation, and did all within our power, while also personally managing the storm. The big Magneto floodlight which you were charging your phone on is really bright for the space, and the 2 candles are only for added ambience. The staff did flop dropping more candles and lights off during the daytime, as they accidentally took it to the wrong unit that day, and with all their phones dead, it was a case of broken telephone communication. But we would have gotten them to you before too late. Then the power came on again before 8pm, so we told the staff not to worry further. We had 42 messages between each other over your 38hours in residence.",

      "comments": "Amazing getaway treehouse. Seth and Tori thought of everything to make your stay so special. I was worried about getting settled because we arrived after dark after a long drive. However, my fears quickly turned into excitement when we saw the treehouse was all lit up and looked so inviting. The minute we walked in we felt right at home. It was hard to believe we were in a treehouse because it was so clean! Even the outside decks and ladders and ramps were free of debris, webs, dirt, etc. You could really tell they spend a lot of time making the treehouse (and all of its amenities) absolutely perfect (inside and outside). There was no road noise when we were there (saw someone mention that in another review). The acorns falling on the tin roof were not loud enough to warrant ear plugs for us. It was actually peaceful. There was a heavy rainstorm one of the nights and that was very loud on the tin roof but manageable with the provided ear plugs and/or a sound machine. Book it now!",

Nicely decorated. <br/>Treehouse is located about a 100 yards off the main road so you can hear car noise throughout the night. A lot of loud reving. <br/>The treehouse is not a secluded as it seems   It does face the woods but when leaves are down you can see the main house and neighboring property through the windows. <br/>Woke up the first night to find small ant’s crawling on me and the comforter covered in them. Most were dead but still some crawling around. Apparently they were coming in from the skylight over the bed. Owners were aware from guest prior to us and informed us the following day after our arrival but would have been nice to know before arriving and not having a great nights sleep for 2 nights.  Probably would have made other arrangements and rescheduled when it was taken care of.",

Slippers, robes, shower shoes plus all the sweet decor. <br/>Small fridge with freezer plus a full cooler with ice kept our food cold. Pizza oven, grill and toaster to cook our food. Basic utensils etc provided. We brought paper products to avoid doing dishes. Plenty of wooded property to take walks. Played the game Shut the box for the first time and became addicted. So many areas to relax in and around the treehouse. The outdoors lighting was lovely and on timers. We always had hot water in the bathroom and shower. <br/>Hosts communication excellent and replied to our messages and concern.  <br/>We had a relaxing rejuvenating time. <br/>After checkout we went to Stumphouse Tunnel/Park. Isaqueena Falls and Yellow Falls trail. Also highly recommend but Yellow Falls Trail is an arduous 45 min hike to the falls and 45 min hike back.",

While it felt a little odd walking up and seeing this rustic cabin, my husband actually was very freaked out.  He completely was underwhelmed as we drove up.  He thought, 'What did my wife get us into!'  While I saw the pictures online, I too thought-' Holy Moly... What is this!?'  But when walking up, we were elated!!  ITs so beautiful.  This was amazing.  The outdoor shower was amazing- HOT HOT Water!!  The Cabin was so clean and no bugs, I only saw one little beetle.  Which I appreciate because I HATE BUGS.  I know crazy right?  Why would I go to a TREEHOUSE.  Well, because it was so romantic and isolated.  We felt like we were the only people around.  Like an Adam and Eve experience without the snake.  Thank you so much Seth and Tori!",

It was so beautiful, and  all the thought and details put into the guests stay was above and beyond! It was a little less secluded than we expected, but we still had privacy and had no problems. We would definitely come back!",

And since then, we've continued to build treehouses and domes in other beautiful nature settings across the USA. \n\nCheck out our treehouses on Netflix's \"The World's Most Amazing Vacation Rentals\" and on Chip & Joanna Gaines' Magnolia Network!\n\nWe love traveling the world with Airbnb! Our goal as 27x Superhosts is for everyone who visits one of our places to feel like they're finally home.

The house was a nice distance from the road and even though there were others staying in neighboring units, privacy wasn’t an issue. The amenities really made for a great experience. The unit we stayed in (unit 7) was beautiful. The owner was informative and respectful. Our busy schedule only allowed us to stay for a night, but that was all we needed. Our private chef, Michele, was delightful. My fiancé and I both agree that we like a softer bed than the one provided. All in all our anniversary was thoroughly enjoyable and this place helped make that possible. I certainly hope to stay here again for longer than just one night.",

So much natural light and the home is nestled in a private wooded area, but really just off the beaten path of the hustle and bustle of the big city. We dipped in the hot tub on the cool night that we were there, and slept sooo comfortably in the nice DARK room! One of the few times I actually slept really well in a an Airbnb! The bathroom being detached in a somewhat shared space is a little awkward, but it was fine. We really enjoyed our stay overall. Wish we had one more night!",

But other than that we absolutely loved this space!! It was so much fun and really cool to take pictures in! It’s also fairly close to downtown if you’re interested in shopping. The host was extremely responsive and helped us with whatever we needed during our stay. Great experience and would recommend it for anyone!",

Turned out they were only hungry because we arrived before feeding time 😂<br/><br/>The food was great. Nothing beats a simple recipe made with fresh ingredients. We bought a pack of eggs as a souvenir 😁",

Pop, Nut and staff were the excellent hosts. They went above and beyond, for example taking us around the farm and explaining everything, they even prepared breakfast for us even though it wasn't included. The farm experience is also amazing. We get to learn more about local agriculture which is very interesting (especially a group of hens in the maze!) This place is highly recommended if you want to spend your holidays with your family and experience the authentic organic farm stay in Thailand. ",

The backyard has a lawn for the kids to run around and has a connecting door to the chicken every day.<br/>🌳 The area around the kids can run around, including a fish pond, a pond, a ducks, goose, farm, vegetable conversion, and rice paddies.<br/>👩‍👧‍👧Hosts provide us a guided tour guide to tell us the story of the farm, and we have a long guide to the farm, auntie Kaew and two dogs day in which they walk, feed the chicken, and pick up the eggs. There's time for him to take us.<br/>🙂 All I loved it, introduced the family to have kids for activities not far from BKK.<br/>👍The kids have a place to run around, ride bicycles too, kids like to pick their eggs and go to the farm again.<br/>The 🌞👍👩‍👧‍👧brothers are very helpful at the ranch.",

Yes, this busy city has been keeping us busy :) Our house gives you a great access to many cool parts of the town. The riverfront is an easy 20 minute taxi ride away. From here, you can take a long-tail boat to old-town area and the Grand Palace. Bangkok's biggest park, Lumpini, is 2 train stations away. Morning jog or evening sunset watching here is never a bad idea. Sound inviting enough? We hope you will LOVE Bangkok as much as we do! ",

It felt like such a novelty to stay there! We opted to have the romantic dinner and the set up, meal, and service was great. They catered well for vegetarians. Would definitely stay again if we have the opportunity!",

      "comments": "If you want to rough it up a bit and unplug from the busier sides of Bali, this is the place for it! The views are unbeatable and the staff is absolutely wonderful! They will work with you night and day to make sure you’re happy! The bamboo house is stunning and as comfortable as can be, given the fact it’s in a quite remote location. We recommend working with the amazing staff to plan tours to Pura Lempuyang, Tirta Gangga, rice paddies, and waterfalls. The subcontracted massage therapists are also wonderful and work with really good rates. Due to the remoteness of the location, Wi-Fi may be spotty. Make sure to take advantage of the mornings, as it rains pretty consistently in the afternoons during wet season in this side of Bali.",

      "comments": "What a unique and beauitful stay in Sidemen! <br/>It is quite breathtaking the view and the villa itself. All the detail of the bamboo villa are quite spectacular and make it extremely special. <br/>The staff at Veluvana were so lovely and responsive and really made the trip. <br/>Although quite remote, the property has an onsite kitchen which you can order any meal.<br/>We opt'd for the Romantic Dinner on our first night, which was stunning with flower display and candles, along with a 3 course meal.<br/>Only cirticism I will say is that there are a few workers in the rice fields, so its not always completely private. With the villa being quite open, it didn't always feel completely private. Within saying that they were always quite respectful and never looking in. <br/>Again, with other villas on the property, there was an incident with our neighbours using drones at 7AM in the morning. Once reported the team asked them to stop. Overall a magical and beautifu stay!",

The staff go above and beyond to make sure your stay is special, yet respectful of your privacy… Loads of lovely restaurants within walking distance however the food at the villa is also fantastic.. breakfast pancakes are a must as well as the local fruits .. Gede kindly got us different local fruit from the market to try at breakfast .. Terima kasih !!",

What really made our Honeymoon there special was the attention to detail and how much the staff made sure we were comfortable and happy. The best hosts we have ever experienced! Will be back :)",

Not only was the accommodation amazing, Gede the manager was so lovely, he was so happy and dedicated to his job and his happiness and enthusiasm was contagious. We booked the romantic dinner for two and Gede personally looked after us during this experience, serving us our food and making us laugh and smile throughout the night. Gede so kind and willing to go the extra mile for us, he even offered to go to the local market before we checked out at 6am just so we could try the local Indonesian fruit such as Snake Fruit but it rained Heavily so the market did not open (thank you Gede we managed to try some later on in our trip). 10/10 service and 10/10 accommodation.",

The whole staff was very attentive and responsive to any questions or requests we made. The view was amazing waking up to every morning and you were completely immersed in nature the whole time. Bugs were never an issue, especially with the net over the bed. Highly recommend this for anyone visiting Sideman or Bali in general.",

The pictures don't do it justice, when you come over the little hill and see the treehouse for the first time, your jaw drops. <br/>  The Treehouse was very clean, the linen and towels perfect.  We brought our own mosquito net, but we didn't need it, as yours was perfect. <br/>  The outdoor kitchen was perfect for our cooking needs. <br/>The shower had hot water, and having it downstairs is perfect for showering after enjoying hicking and river.  The pool was refreshing and great for exercise.  <br/>   I will warn people who don't know, it gets windy sometimes, and  the Treehouse will shake a bit, that is normal. <br/>The great ingeneering that went into the build will keep you perfectly safe.  <br/>  Download some good books over by the pool area, so that you can read when off line in the treehouse. <br/>  Our Valentines was perfect here. <br/>Thank you, Jose",

The property is breathtaking, the tree house is unique and one of a kind, the details and hard work put into the land is outstanding, the amenities are great, the river and trails must be swam in and explored. If you have the opportunity to stay here, do it. <br/><br/>They have a pool, people on site with a bar to make drinks and really so much to do. We wish we had more time! If you have the opportunity to meet Frank, be sure to chat with him. He’s full of great stories and insight. <br/><br/>Thank you again!",

To be able to stay in a tree house is such an incredible experience, and to make it even better you can hear and see the river that's right next to it. You are surrounded by trees, you connect with nature. I highly recommend this very unique space for anyone who wants to experience nature to the fullest.",

Were there in torrential thunderstorm and river rose significantly but no flooding and tree house stayed mostly dry. Splendid wild life. Saw many birds including many kingfishers plus 2 otters in the river. Grounds, garden and pool are meticulously maintained. Were not too many mosquitoes and bugs when we were there. Not for those who need nighttime accommodation with doors and windows or who are afraid of the outdoors",

There is a helpful guide inside the property for all your needs and even advice on where to go, walks available and places to eat and see.<br/><br/>Without having to worry about any heating as example, as quite literally the technology looks after the property, this spacious retreat boasts views over the fields to watch the sunset. It’s remote location is superb positioned if you want to head to Canterbury or Port Lympne as example, but also realising we can hit most of Kent’s coasts within 30mins drive, made us want to explore more of the county through the winding lanes that is dubbed the Gardens of England.<br/><br/>An effortless stay, we have already recommended!",

However, the food isn’t very good and it’s not close enough to things to walk for other food. We were very disappointed that they didn’t let us know there would be loud construction on the back of our room until we arrived, much too late to change any of our plans at that point. It would be worth checking in with them to confirm that renovations or construction won’t be happening when you book, because it really hampered our ability to relax. Can’t say we would stay again.",

I ended up cancelling our st Mary tiny house reservation to stay here 3 nights and I’m so happy we did! We enjoyed being more secluded and on the edge of the park. The solo sits on the edge of the property and the deck is perfect for glassing for animals as the sun sets. We saw countless amounts of deer, pheasants and grouse. The silo is very well done. It was nice and warm, had a hot shower and full kitchen for heating up our meals. The bed was comfy and a Mountain View out every window. There is construction on hwy 206 so we took a parallel road and ended up seeing a elk herd. I highly recommend staying here! We hope to return!",

Now something I’d like to mention is if you stay, step outside on the porch upstairs in the middle of the night, and just look around…the stars are amazing :)<br/>Also, we enjoyed just sitting in the afternoon and watching the deer play in the field. There is also a hawk in the tree nearby that I enjoyed watching.  Steve was an exceptional host! He  answered any questions we had with a quick response. We thank you for our visit!!!!!

Having access to the farm each day included,  was a massive bonus for us as the kids enjoyed feeding the animals, playing in the various play areas and the train and beetle rides!  We’d definitely return.",

Daisy was the most shaded of the cow sheds and although the weather was hot, it stayed nice and cool inside. The hammock and tea bags and milk were a lovely touch. We are already planning our return!",

So clean as were the showers etc, and we even had a BBQ and utensils. <br/><br/>Beautiful location and not too far from us which was great. Everyone on the farm was so friendly and approachable, we were a little confused when we initially arrived but it was dealt with really quickly and set the tone for how relaxed our next few days was going to be. <br/><br/>The fact we also got entry to the farm was amazing. We have been on a lot of day trips and farm visits but this was by far the most child friendly and we couldn’t even fit all of the activities into one day! <br/><br/>I could go on, but I think I’ve said most of what I wanted to! <br/><br/>We will definitely be backs to stay at Daisy and to camp too.",

Kids loved the access to all the animals, the large play area and the fun wagon rides. <br/>Cafe is okay, not amazing quality but certainly sufficient and does the job. Shared bathroom are kept nice and clean and bonus points for the family bathroom that comes with a bath (great if you have very little kids)<br/>Location is lovely and rural, 10mins from a Coop, a decent chippy and an Indian take out. We drove the 20mins to Aldeburgh  beach and it was well worth a day out.",

That is where you will spend all your time.  It also does not have neighbors on either side, so you can play music and be a little loud without bothering the neighbors.  Mario was also very communicative and a great host.",

      "comments": "After traveling all over Peru, it was great to end my trip at this cute a d adorable Dome in the Sacred valley. My partner and I woke up to breath taking views of the Andes mountains,lush gardens and the sounds of birds hanging out in the trees. The location is near Pisac, there, you can go to local markets,shop in the town where local artisans make the most amazing cloths and trinkets and eat some good local food.After a long day of hiking and traveling it was great to relax and stay put. Our hostess Milagros  welcomed my partner and I with open arms. It was wonderful meeting people in the small area. we enjoyed every minute of our time there. The neighbors were lovely with wonderful pets. we felt so welcomed. Words can't describe how amazing that place is, all I know is that it touched me so deeply  that I can't wait to go back.",

Most of the kitchen tools are not in a condition to use.<br/><br/>The place full of mosquitoes ,flies and spiders. the net that is supposed to prevent it was apparently torn<br/><br/>The owner barley reply to me. Once asked for recommendations and didn’t get much of a help.<br/><br/>Every time I went outside they were 5-6 hugest dogs were running and jumping on me. <br/>I love dogs but that’s didn’t feel so safe at night <br/><br/>There were many things different from the description.<br/>1. There are no hikes from the Airbnb. To go to the waterfalls from the Airbnb. U must take a van for 30min to do any hike.<br/>2. It’s not 60 sol taxi from Cusco.I was talking with the taxi drivers they mentioned, and they asked 150% more.",

The host had her teenage son meet me, and he was very sweet, but didn't seem to be trained in orienting a guest. He didn't know the wifi password and said he would get back to me. And did not. I just used my data on my phone instead. When I went to take a shower shortly before check-out, I discovered the hot water heater would not turn on. Maybe there were instructions that could have been included? They did let me check out an hour late which I really appreciated. I might stay again because of the peaceful location, but would get necessary information in advance so I would be prepared for little communication. Also, the description says conscious community, which I thought might mean there would be a community atmosphere. I am traveling solo and look for opportunities to connect. Everyone in this community keeps to themselves. They are very friendly if you pass them by, but the guest is not necessarily included in activities. That was not promised, I made that up. And, you should not expect that there is community there.",

But the owner are very on their own. There was no more communication or interaction after checkin. We felt always like we were bothering them when there was a problem, like the internet not working.

Also thought it was cute that they showed their dogs in the book incase you have dogs or just see them about<br/><br/>The only two minor things I could say (which is why I gave 4/5 stars)<br/>Although there was instructions for how to burn the wood for the hot tub, it was quite complicated to work and we gave up In the end. I do understand however when we went it was winter and electric is not in everyone’s budget.<br/>Road noise can be loud but is stated it’s next to a road.<br/>All in all, would recommend!",

I think we had assumed it would be a bit more private and secluded as we had a couple of people walking by who could see us in the hot-tub, but that's more my interpretation rather than anything misleading in the description! <br/>There was also no outdoor lighting during our stay, but otherwise we had all that we needed. Overall, this is a really lovely place and was really clean!<br/>Louise",

The bedding for the sofa bed is stored in the L shaped part which lifts up - I’m sorry you couldn’t find it - we will add this to the information folder. I apologise that you found the lack of outside lighting tricky; the solar lighting we had, had failed and we have wired deck lights due to be fitted tomorrow in fact. Hopefully, this will make it easier now that the nights have drawn in.",

We sat out in it a lot and found once it was up to temperature it stayed that way or was easy to re heat because of the cover. Clare has thought of everything you might need, and communication was very clear. We wanted a relaxing few days and we certainly got that so thank you. I can’t recommend it enough. The only thing to note, is that a road runs behinds the property. You can’t see it, but you can hear it. It isn’t constant but it is noticeable and does mean it isn’t totally peaceful at all times. It wasn’t a problem for us and would not stop me from returning.",

Check in was smooth and we were left to our own devices, it's equipped with everything you would need and there are some lovely surprise touches. I would agree with some of the other reviews that it's not situated as we would have expected, near a road and visually in sight of other cottages but we could barely hear the road from inside and it's so quiet at night that it did not disturb us one bit, even when we were outside in the hot tub which we did most evenings. It's on a beautiful plot of land and very thoughtfully done. Would highly recommend.",

Hot tub was great fun & the dressing gowns & slippers were a nice touch too. Sadly, we did check out 2 days early as the location was not what we were expecting. We came to Norfolk looking for a truly peaceful get away in a beautiful part of the country but the constant loud road noise, which is just over the hedge, went on all day & night really spoilt it for us. Being such a busy A road with huge lorries thundering past kept us awake all night & during the day there was no rest from it either. There was also a lot of dog hair on the sofa which was unfortunate particularly as I asked the host prior to arriving if it could get an extra good clean as I have allergies. If the location was quiet & peaceful then I would have given this 4 or 5 stars because we didn’t really have much else to complain about.",

The outside is gorgeous but our favorite part of the stay was one of the cats!! She is the sweetest thing EVER and we fell in love with her. Her name is S̄eụ̄xdāw we learned, which is Thai for leopard. She’s the one with different brown and gray colors! The location is a little far from the town, so the cost of rides added up fast. Our place had a little bit of a funky smell but it was very clean and they make sure there are no bugs before you check in. That was amazing. We booked an extra night than originally planned because we really enjoyed the stay. Having AC and hot water was a blessing.",

The details in regards to the original Jupiter 2 are very good. The sleeping arrangements are not what I expected, but they work!<br/>You must be prepared to have your food and snacks with you for a better experience. Sunset was at 4:25 and I am nor comfortable driving unknown country roads at night.<br/>Kirby is a delightful and very responsive.",

None of us had climbed nor ziplined anything remotely close to this, but the guides were very helpful, informative, and reassuring. The food was delicious, and the view was spectacular. I could go on all day about this adventure. Do yourself the favor of experiencing this!<br/><br/>Many thanks to Daniel, Leo and Marco!",

We also received a healthy tasty breakfast prior to coming down via zipline. This was truly memorable, highly recommend staying at Natalia's place. You will not regret it.",

The via ferrata might be a little nerve inducing at first if you’re afraid of heights but it takes very little time to get in the swing of things and I was confident that the route was secure. The staff was incredible throughout the experience! I highly recommend paying the extra fee for the photography, our pictures turned out fantastic! The food provided was great. The bed in our skylodge was the most comfortable we found in Peru, with wonderful pillows as well. Obviously, the view is magnificent! The zip lining down in the morning was a blast. I cannot recommend this experience more!",

Climbing the via ferrata up always felt safe and still exhilarating, and same applies to the zipline down, with major thanks to the guides involved for helping out here. The photoshoot offered was well worth the added cost, and was quite fun with the photographer. I especially loved the small touches like the large tea selection with the hot water for the morning, the playing cards and dominoes, and even the fresh smelling pot pourri in the bathroom underneath the tissues. One of a kind marvelous experience!",

I stayed with my friend and boyfriend for three nights and rated the place 5 stars. <br/><br/>One caveat though with staying and trying to relax in Nacpan Beach… There are a LOT of merchants walking around really forcing you to buy things from them. They can’t take no for an answer and really will follow you around, even when you’re lounging trying to relax. One of them even grabbed my friend’s wrist as she was walking away. I know they’re just trying to make a living, but maybe there’s an opportunity there to regulate it more, if possible. We dreaded going out of the premises to walk around the beach because they are always waiting by the gate.",

Tricycle is another option 700-800 pesos per ride one way Nacpan to El nido proper.<br/><br/> the place is very nice, the staff is very accommodating and you have good privacy. The bathroom is separate from the tent, but its cleaned all the time.<br/><br/>Food is good too. They prepare your breakfast both Filipino and or American dish. Thank you Nacpan Glamping it was a great experience at the tent and the beach.",

The biggest issue we had was the resort trying to charge us extra or over charge us for things we had already paid for or had previously been quoted a price on. IMO, it seemed like they may have been trying to take advantage of tourists that don’t pay close attention to their bill. Our AC also didn’t work the first night so we had to switch rooms and the restaurant seemed to be out of a lot of things",

      "comments": "Filiberto’s tower house was absolutely the most unique stay I’ve ever had. And if you’re looking for something that you’ve never experienced before in your life, and truly unique this is the place for you. Myself, my husband and my two teens (in the end) ended up loving this stay. Unfortunately upon arrival it seems that Filiberto’s cleaners had put in less effort than expected off of both us as guests and the host. He was so apologetic and helpful and was fast to try to help with anything the cleaners forgot. There are also a few safety hazards that I have discussed with the host and hope for the health and safety of others that these are fixed. Outside of these instances we actually had a phenomenal time. We all acted like big kids again, playing Jack sparrow music and pretending to be pirates laughing and giggling all the way. Some key memories as a family were made on this tower and I we will never forget our stay. I would recommend 2-3 night stay max at this Airbnb. Great location",

Take a real inventory of yourself before committing to the space. There really are no walls or TV or AC. You really do have to take a small boat out to the tower and tie it up. If these things make you uncomfortable, check out his other listing. Filiberto is very nice and very interested in making sure that your stay is great. We would love to stay again.",

If you are looking for an unusual and unforgettable overnight stay on a self-constructed tower on the water with views to a non-touristy waterfront neighbourhood, should definitely visit Filiberto. Be aware that it is a bit adventurous, since it has no walls. 😉 Book some days in advance, so he can arrange everything (cause usually he lives there). <br/>Thanks Filiberto for letting us stay in your very special house!",

The baths are really special experience…….took us 4 hours to heat the water up but that’s all part of the fun. We found the bed in the Conker really comfortable too - so much so we slept 10 hours each night. No visits from the squirrels for us but a visit from one of the pigs - which made us laugh. If thinking of booking, it’s definitely a must for a different kind of camping.",

Amazing views, great location - lots of sheep - lovely, hungry pigs. They provide more than enough basics/essentials. Absolutely would recommend. 2 nights wasn’t enough for our liking!",

      "response": "Hi Oliver,\r<br/>Thanks so much for leaving this incredibly detailed review which we will take the time to study and see what we can improve. We are glad you enjoyed it. Overall I see where you feel we could have given you a more sustained feeling of luxury with respect to the food and fridge which would have been particularly noticeable this summer.\r<br/>We have some ideas for a communal eco fridge for next year which would reduce waste and give longer stays the possibility of storing things for longer.\r<br/>\r<br/>I dont know many places which are more secluded though than our lovely shady tree filled estate. Each pod has totally separate facilities designed for it as well as a new design for each one which requires a lot of love, time and energy to service…so I am puzzled as to why you think it isn’t secluded. I will definitely look into it though. All the very best,\r<br/>Anjana and David",

      "comments": "We did enjoy our stay however, for the price the execution of the final details wasn't what I'd expect for almost £200 per night.<br/><br/>Yes, we took headtorches & hand torches as recommended however, the lighting that was provided mostly didn't work; the battery LED lights didn't work, the string lighting from the road down towards the conker didn't work and in most cases, the wires had snapped, were tied in with plants on the ground or were totally disconnected from the solar cell. There was also zero lighting to the toilet, for the price we paid I would have expected far better. <br/><br/>Also, a lot of the wood supplied was wet so struggled to start the fire at times and the axe was incredibly blunt, which makes it more dangerous to use and much more difficult to make kindling from.<br/><br/>The trees & brambles scratched our car each time we drove in & out, which will cost money to rectify. <br/><br/>Also, the instructions for different types of waste was confusing and not clear where bags were for different waste products.<br/><br/>Finding the Conker was easy enough with the detailed instructions however, when then asked to park your vehicle 'in the car park you passed', this wasn't clear where the car park was, as it wasn't signposted anywhere, wasn't highlighted in the instructions before you reach the Conker and where we assume we were supposed to park, there were vehicles there already for the Tree Top tent, so felt like we would have been stealing another customers parking space for their accommodation.<br/><br/>The Conker is also not as secluded as is made out in the accommodation description. The road to some of the other accommodation onsite is only about 15yards up the banking from the door to the Conker. Due to this, it was possible to see into the conker if the door was open and also down to the cooking & fire pit area from the road - made very clear when a family walked along the road and we heard a young girl in the family shout to someone they were walking with 'Look, I can see people down there, they're having a fire', which destroys the notion of total privacy & seclusion and may make you reluctant to use the bath & shower facilities, if you know you could be seen by other guests.<br/><br/>The Conker itself is nicely decorated and the windows facing the sky give a great perspective when laying on the bed,  but it gets VERY warm in there when the weather is nice and there's no ventilation beyond opening the door (which as we mentioned makes you visible from the road) and also encourages flying insects to come in. A can of Raid was provided to deal with these, but for the price I'd rather not have to choose between sweating all night or having to fumigate where I'm then going to sleep with dead flies around. <br/><br/>The lack of any ability to keep food cool is a major drawback for anyone staying longer than about 2 nights. We did bring a cooler bag as advised, with 4 ice packs in there and brought fresh food, drinks, meat etc for the BBQ. In retrospect, with the bag being sat outside in the kichen area and warming up from the moment we left home, it's not really safe to have food warming for days to then eat - with the only alternative being leaving the site to find a supermarket, which takes away from the wilderness experience. This was tipified by the milk which had been left for us to use (thank you for that, along with the Welsh cakes) had gone off in the cooler bag by the 3rd morning. A simple solution to this would be to provide a small gas fridge for guests to use to keep food chilled, fresh & safe for days. <br/><br/>Overall, we did enjoy our experience of cooking the BBQs, doing the fires for the bathwater etc, however considering what you're expected to bring, details that have been missed and the lack of genuine seclusion means we left feeling disappointed, especially after paying so much per night.",

We are glad you enjoyed it. Overall I see where you feel we could have given you a more sustained feeling of luxury with respect to the food and fridge which would have been particularly noticeable this summer. We have some ideas for a communal eco fridge for next year which would reduce waste and give longer stays the possibility of storing things for longer. I dont know many places which are more secluded though than our lovely shady tree filled estate. Each pod has totally separate facilities designed for it as well as a new design for each one which requires a lot of love, time and energy to service…so I am puzzled as to why you think it isn’t secluded. I will definitely look into it though. All the very best, Anjana and David",

In fact, we felt able to 'run free' for some time following our use of the bath. Not your usual experience of camping, at least not ours. Very wonderful. <br/><br/>The facilities at the moon conker were great.<br/><br/>No phone signal AT ALL down there which is what we wanted<br/><br/>Lovely to see the pigs at hogwarts and our dog had some amusing encounters with the sheep.<br/><br/><br/>The negatives were the booking date was altered at very short notice and meant we only got one night in moon conker. We were promised compensation which wasn't given. A little chaotic. The lane to the conkers is also pretty agricultural, more so than the instructions even would make you expect and I did fear damaging my car, although in the end we were fine.<br/><br/>Overall, the experience at moon conker is exactly what we wanted. A reset of the soul. And we'd definitely recommend it. Even though we had some minor issues.<br/><br/>We'd like to go again for sure in future some time.",

We're SO glad you loved all that the estate had to offer and you have our sincere apologies for the snafus when it came to the last minute change to your booking - if you'd like to come visit Moon Conker and stay for a few nights we'd love to create a special offer just for you - just give us a poke when you're ready to come again!  If you're a real off-gridder then Moon is just GORGEOUS in the autumn as the leaves start to change - the risk of course being that the weather is...well, a bit Welsh! Even then, though, you have the nice cozy log burner to keep you and your toes toasty.",

As it’s really back to basics, the baths where an amazing experience, the amount of land we had to explore around the area was bliss, the moon conker was spacious for 2 people and got really warm with the fire inside it which was one thing we where worried about when arriving in the cold & rain, I would 100% recommend to our friends and looking forward to coming back & doing the earth conker and treetops, we want to try it all now!

We were given a set of directions/images to enable us to locate the conker but we didn’t find them to be very clear, they were quite confusing and in my opinion some steps were open to interpretation which resulted in us going the wrong way up a very steep hill, a map would probably have been more useful. <br/><br/>When we located the accommodation it looked really nice on first impressions and we were very excited to get a fire going, heat up the baths and make pizzas with the pizza oven provided. However we were only left 2 small bags of kindling so as we had no logs we couldn’t heat up the bath, fire and make pizzas, we only had enough kindling to keep a fire going for approx 1 and a half hours. This was really disappointing and if being honest it put a dampener on our trip. The only reason I booked the conker was because of the baths and for the opportunity to sit in the bath and watch the stars, given it’s situated in a dark sky location. Unfortunately as we couldn’t heat them up and we had no logs to make the fire we had no choice but to go to bed early as it was too cold to sit outside without any heat, so we didn’t get to experience conker to the fullest, we could have been anywhere if I’m honest and it felt like we hadn’t gotten our moneys worth at all. <br/><br/>Due to the location being off grid and back to basics we didn’t want to have to drive whilst we were at the conker but due to the lack of wood provided the next morning we had to take a drive to the nearest shop that we could find so we could buy some. When I got signal again I saw a message from the previous day from the host advising that the “woodsman” had left some logs for us at the conker (the 2 bags of kindling). I messaged back to say we didn’t have any logs so we were on our way to buy some and I also asked where the funnel was for the bath as when we were reading the instructions on how to fill them a funnel was mentioned. The host replied saying that the previous guests had melted the funnel and didn’t acknowledge the lack of wood, again I was disappointed as a simple acknowledgment/apology probably would have made me feel less disappointed that I’d spent money on something that was unusable. The host didn’t say anything about dropping wood off at the conker so we spent £40 on wood so we could get the full experience. Also to add it would be helpful to either replace the funnel or update your instructions so guests aren’t spending time looking for things that aren’t there. <br/><br/>When we got back to the conker the log storage box had been filled to the brim with wood and kindling, showing us what we should have been greeted with the previous day. I couldn’t help but feel upset that this small action of replenishing the wood could have made our first night dramatically more enjoyable and not like I’d wasted my money. <br/><br/>Before our stay i received a lot of information and it was a little bit like information overload and I do believe that this could be simplified or provided in paper form at the conker so it can be fully digested. The annoying part of this for me was there was an list of essential items to bring which included flip flops and a toothbrush but no fire wood so I assumed we didn’t have being any, again adding to my disappointment above. <br/><br/>One final thing was that check out on air B and B states 11am, however in the information pack it states 10:30am (quite early in my opinion considering check in is 4pm). I emailed the host to clarify as the info was conflicting but she directed me to a link for the information pack and suggested I read it if I hadn’t already. Quite annoying as she could have just cleared in up in a quick message. <br/><br/>The second night was a lot more enjoyable as we were able to experience the baths and sit by the fire and watch the stars but I wouldn’t personally recommend booking the conker based on my experience as the attention to detail was lacking. I do think the pizza oven could also do with a clean as it was full of soot. The conker itself is beautiful and unique but it’s a shame the added touches weren’t up to standard.",

We live here with our three children/design consultants who constantly inspire us with crazy ideas! As a family, we only build getaways that we're passionate about. We put a strong emphasis on upcycling, sustainability and integrating our ideas into the environment.\r\n\r\nLawyers by trade, we swapped courtroom for courtyard and now we are always on the look for the next unique project. We're very excited to share our creations :)\r\n",

The pool is magical especially at night, there are pool towels provided and we spent a lot of our time here haha. The cleanliness of the room was very good and the staff were very accomodating in that aspect. The food is really good! Even though it’s vegetarian, it’s very flavoursome and filling (my partner and I love meat haha). The bed’s are comfortable and the shower pressure is amazing. <br/><br/>The only issues we had, is obviously the noise and the heat. It does state this in the description upon booking, so I don’t fault Le Bamboo bali for that as you are pre-warned before you go about the noises at night and there only being a fan because of the hut being semi open. My partner and I both struggle with heat, so the fan just wasn’t enough for us personally. Also, we had a lizard upstairs or somewhere near by and he was very loud at night 🤣 the crickets were also very loud, so if you’re a light sleeper you might want to take that into consideration. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, the stay at Le Bamboo Bali was amazing!!",

Our hosts Christian and his wife made us feel welcome they are very sweet people. I stayed here with my family of 5 comfortably. The view from the outside table is breathtaking. We drove to Baza about 15 mins away for dinner. I highly recommend Cu-chah restaurant. They have great service with great food. I believe they open at 8pm. Lastly, if you’re thinking about it?, just do it. You won’t regret it.",

There’s not much around and you need a car to get around but we went to the shops and cooked some lovely food and wine, the kitchen is very well equipped! I would 100% go again, such beautiful surroundings too. Very clean and hosts are always around if you need them. They have designed the space so well and the pool area is beautiful with little beds in the shade perfect for a little siesta. We had a small 4 month old baby and they provided us with a baby bath and a cot. Would deffo recommend for a chilled little break away. Thank you!!",

Kind gestures never go amiss - Laurence dropped in a huge bunch of grapes straight from the vine one day, another evening we were graciously invited to dine with the hosts & other guests (though our kids had made other plans that evening so we had to decline) yet another morning Christian brought coals/wood for any BBQ we might make. They displayed a great balance between un-intrusive & superbly helpful.<br/>A beautiful couple, so welcoming, an amazing spot in its entirety & so passionately built for the comfort of their guests! <br/>Oh & if you think 3 teens will be bored in 3-4 days? No!  <br/>The local village, a drive away,  hasn’t lots to offer though we enjoyed good value pizza in the Roca restaurant & went to Baza one night. However, it’s not for clubbing we came! <br/>Christian & Laurence, thank you both so much!!",

Our home was beautiful - so many thoughtful touches throughout the cave and in the communal areas. <br/>An amazing communal BBQ and huge outdoor table for entertaining - we had every meal at this table and made friends with the other lovely guests that were staying at the caves. <br/>The pool is fantastic, plenty of room for everyone and the poolside chill caves were ideal to get some shade from the sun.<br/>We wish we could give this stay more than five stars... without doubt the best AirBnB we have ever visited, we were so sad to leave, and have already booked for next year!!<br/><br/>Christian & Laurence - merci beaucoup, the perfect hosts!!!",

And oh my, we got so much more than we ever expected. A magical oasis set in the most beauitful setting with even more amazing hosts! <br/>Not only were the caves in imactulate condition Christian and his Wife went above and beyond for our stay and made it one to remember! <br/>We could only stay 2 nights and wish we could have stayed much longer. There is so much more to do in the area or perfect for just realxing. So no matter how long you have we can't recommend this place enough..<br/>We miss it already and can't wait to return again one day :)",

Both hosts were inttenitive wanting us to have the best stay possible. The pool was lovely, tad cold, but which is expected from a salt water pool. There were lots of great things to do in the local area including owl experiences and kayaking on the stunning Negratin Reservior. Finding restaurants and supermarkets can be a bit of a drive but it was worth it for the peaceful tranquility of the caves. The hosts are always on hand to help with directions or questions about the area.  Just be prepared for a few flies.",

If your partner like such places.<br/><br/>When we stay, it was a windy weather so whole night I can hear the wind and trees. Those wind sounds, gives the impression that we are living on the seaside. Just for info, if you can't sleep in such sound, then bring your own ear plugs. <br/><br/>We also ordered the breakfast, and it got delivered in the basket and hang to the rope. We pulled up the room and enjoyed it on the small, cozy terrace. The coffee was hot and breakfast is also great for such a place. <br/><br/>When I wanted to book this, I was going through the reviews and nobody mentioned the toilets. <br/>Well we stayed for one night, the treehouse is equipped with dry washroom which is good for small stuff but for big dump. I would recommend go to the proper toilet, which is in the restaurant next to the entrance and it is around 5 minutes walk from the hut.",

      "comments": "A decent stay in the middle of no where. Nothing much to do in the surrounding area. In the winters there is no natural light after 5.30 pm and if it’s raining you are kind of stuck in the tree house without Wi-Fi. <br/>Also the rooms are tiny, meaning sitting too long inside playing games is slightly difficult. <br/>Although I would not recommend it to families with kids. But it might still be good for young couples. <br/>The host is good and the communication is well. The tree house in itself is one of the kind and very beautiful. <br/>The shared bathrooms are decent for what can be expected in the forest.",

It is very basic, there’s only a bed (which was very comfortable) and a seating area inside and an outside seating platform but if your looking for a once in a lifetime outdoors experience this is the place for you. We also ate in the restaurant which was absolutely amazing. It was a real fine dining experience. Thank you so much Jean-Marie",

The (vegetarian) breakfast-basket was lovely as well and the coffee tasted really good. Chris and me are very tall people but we were able to stand inside the treehouse what is big bonus. <br/>Didn’t give a try to the toilet inside the treehouse, because restrooms are only 3min away. <br/><br/>Some Tipps:<br/>For cold nights, there is a small heater inside but better be prepared and take warm clothing for sleeping ;) <br/>If you want to eat your own food at the treehouse, you need to take some dishes / plates with you.",

Etwas schwierig war die Kommunikation mit dem Gastgeber. Wir haben leider nicht auf all unsere Fragen eine Antwort erhalten, was mich vor der Anreise verunsichert hat ob alles funktioniert. Besonders gut hat mir der Frühstücksservice gefallen, welches am Moergen per Korb und Seilzug geliefert wurde.",

C’est une cabane pas un hôtel où un chalet. N’espérer pas y retrouver le même confort. Mais l’expérience est très agréable.  Ça fait du bien d’être déconnecté. Les toilettes et la douche communs ont toujours été propres alors que toutes les cabanes étaient habitées. Le cadre est cool. On a fait de belles ballades à travers la forêt directement en partant à pied de la cabane. Regardez sur visiorando !! <br/>Jean-Marie c’est montré très sympathique. <br/>Les petits dej étaient bon.",

We slept like kings in the big log bed. We were also able to taste the tasty juice that Mirko and his family produces. We would love to come back. Thanks Mirko... definitely the master not always builds straight :)",

      "comments": "BEST AIRBNB YET!!! I'm travelling the continent, and I never expect the level of accomodation I experienced here. Mirko and family were so welcoming, and the earth house is absolutely delightful.<br/><br/>Perfect place to kick back and relax to get rid of stress. The air and house just smells so nice (because of the wood probably) and the interior is so gorgeously crafted. I got to see the most incredible sunset from the porch my first night. Heating works well and the bed was so comfortable I slept like the dead.<br/><br/>Plenty of hiking or easy walking around the area, and all the people I met in Ljutomer were so unbelievably genial I got a culture shock. Mirko had even provided basics in the fridge for breakfast (eggs, cheese, salami, milk) as well as some of their homemade wine and juice which you just HAVE to buy and bring home. <br/><br/>Definitely will be coming here again the next time I'm in east Europe. Thank you for an amazing new experience and a relaxing break in my travels!",

The location is beautiful, just be mindful to bring some snacks if you plan on staying for a while. I totally love the home and the host was great to deal with. Hope to visit again in the near future. One last thing the road getting to the location is flat but not paved but it is maintained. I believe it will be paved in the near future being that the location seems like it’s growing with beautiful homes all over and the view from this cabin is amazing.",

      "comments": "We really enjoyed our time in this wow location. It is an unique experience to live in a tiny house. Also I really appreciate the guitar position in the yard and the view from the upstairs windows.<br/>However there are a few aspects that cna be improved:<br/>- the time of the light senzor at the bathroom or you need to dance while taking your shower 🚿😂<br/>- a bit more things in the kitchen so you can cook easily and don't get too creative<br/>- a message at the yard entrance: \"don't disturb the guests\"<br/><br/>The place is so unique that everyone wants to see it. So, we as guests, we had many guests coming to take pictures; some of them even asking an inside tour. 😁<br/>Of course I know is not host's fault for that, it's just the \"wow\" factor. But still. 😳",

We went there for the experience of staying and playing the guitar in a Guitar House and, oh, it was a blast!<br/><br/>The attention to details is outstanding, even the outside strings have different thicknesses like real guitar strings.<br/><br/>The place, even though is not too big, is very well organized, and it has lots of storage areas, so we didn't feel overwhelmed by things or overcrowded.<br/><br/>The bedrooms are accessible by climbing a wooden ladder. The beds are comfortable and the view is very relaxing, having the mountains in front of us.<br/><br/>The place was very clean and we had everything we needed in the fully furnished and functional kitchen.<br/><br/>The area is private, very quite, the neighborhood is really nice, the people are respectful and the host was very helpful with everything, being very responsive.<br/><br/>We definitely recommend the place!",

If you value privacy, I don't think it's a good place to stay, but if you don't mind someone that can just watch you sleep it's all good. The view it's amazing, the kitchen has all the necessary things to cook, grill or making coffee / tea. The bathroom it's large enough for such a small place and you have enough towels for everyone. Overall, it's a great place but keep in mind that you have neighbors all around, it's not located alone.",

The beds are very comfortable, and there are some goodies in the fridge from the house.<br/><br/>Only minus is that upstairs the windows don't open. Even though there are air units there, they're noisy and it just doesn't compare to having some fresh cool air from outside.",

Este un loc de liniste si relaxare unde respectam natura si comunitatea din jur indiferent de forma casutei. \r<br/>- Problema caldurii de la etaj a fost deja rezolvata cu un nou AC, pe baza feedbackului primit din primele 2 rezervari,\r<br/>- Este un tiny house, in poze se vede clar ca nu sunt separate camerele intre ele . Nu este o locatie de confort de hotel pentru 4 adulti si 3 bebelusi si am evidentiat acest lucru si telefonic, si prin mesaj imediat dupa efectuarea rezervari iar in anunt este specificat 'not suitable for infants'.",

It is a place of tranquility and relaxation where we respect the nature and the surrounding community regardless of the form of the cottage. \r<br/>- The heat issue upstairs has already been resolved with a new AC, based on the feedback you received from the first 2 reservations,\r<br/>- It's a tiny house, the pictures clearly show that the rooms are not separated . It is not a hotel comfort location for 4 adults and 3 infants and we have also highlighted this by phone, and by message immediately after making reservations and in the listing is specified 'not suitable for infants'."
